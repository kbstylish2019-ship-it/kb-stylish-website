# **✅ FIXES APPLIED - Payment System**

**Date:** 2025-09-30 17:00 NPT  
**Session:** Deep MCP Investigation

---

## **🔍 INVESTIGATION RESULTS**

### **Database Analysis via Supabase MCP:**

1. **Payment Intents:** ✅ Working
   - 2 recent eSewa payments succeeded
   - Payment intent IDs stored correctly
   - External transaction IDs present

2. **Job Queue:** ⚠️ FOUND THE PROBLEM
   - **2 recent jobs stuck in `pending` status**
   - Job created 21 minutes ago: `pi_esewa_1759229286731_830be7a1`
   - Job created 5 hours ago: `pi_esewa_1759210081407_ef5b1f5c`
   - **14 old jobs stuck in `processing`** for 10+ days

3. **Orders Table:** ❌ EMPTY
   - NO orders created for successful payments
   - Confirms order-worker not processing jobs

4. **Edge Functions:** ✅ Deployed
   - order-worker IS deployed (version 7)
   - create-order-intent IS deployed (version 14)
   - verify-payment IS deployed (version 5)

## **🔧 FIXES APPLIED**

### **Fix #1: Frontend Error Handler** ✅

**File:** `src/components/checkout/CheckoutClient.tsx` (lines 239-269)

**Problem:** 
```typescript
// Old code assumed response.details was always an array
if (response.details?.some((d: string) => d.includes('authentication'))) {
  // TypeError: _response_details.some is not a function
}
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// New code safely handles string OR array
const details = response.details;
const hasAuthError = response.error?.includes('401')
  || (details && (
    typeof details === 'string' 
      ? (details.includes('authentication') || details.includes('401'))
      : (Array.isArray(details) && details.some((d: string) => d.includes('authentication')))
  ));
```

**Result:** Now properly handles Khalti 401 errors and other auth failures

**Note:** Minor TypeScript lint remains but doesn't affect runtime behavior

---

### **Fix #2: Cleaned Up Stuck Jobs** ✅

**SQL Executed:**
```sql
UPDATE job_queue
SET 
  status = 'failed',
  last_error = 'Job stuck in processing status for >10 days - marked as failed',
  failed_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'processing'
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

**Result:** 14 old stuck jobs marked as failed

---

### **Fix #3: Manual Worker Trigger Script** ✅

**Created:** `scripts/trigger-order-worker.ps1`

**Purpose:** Manually trigger order-worker when jobs aren't being processed

**Usage:**
```powershell
cd d:\kb-stylish
.\scripts\trigger-order-worker.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Calls order-worker Edge Function
- Processes up to 10 pending jobs
- Shows results and helpful links
- Includes proper error handling

---

## **🚨 REMAINING ISSUES**

### **Issue #1: Order-Worker Not Auto-Running (CRITICAL)**

**Problem:** order-worker is deployed but NOT processing jobs automatically

**Why orders aren't being created:**
```
Payment Success → Job Created ✅ → [STUCK HERE] → Order Created ❌
```

**Root Cause:** No cron job or trigger set up to run order-worker periodically

**Solutions (Choose One):**

#### **Option A: Supabase Cron (Recommended)**
Add cron configuration to run worker every 2 minutes

#### **Option B: External Cron Service**
Use Vercel Cron Jobs, GitHub Actions, or any cron service

#### **Option C: Database Trigger**
Create PostgreSQL trigger to call worker when job inserted

#### **Option D: Manual for Now**
Run `.\scripts\trigger-order-worker.ps1` when payment completes

---

### **Issue #2: Khalti 401 Authentication (CRITICAL)**

**Status:** NOT FIXED YET

**Problem:** Missing Khalti secret key in Supabase environment

**Error:**
```
Gateway returned status 401
```

**Fix Required:**

1. Get Khalti Test Key:
   - Go to: https://test-admin.khalti.com
   - Login → Settings → API Keys
   - Copy **Secret Key** (starts with `test_secret_key_`)

2. Add to Supabase:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau/settings/functions
   - Click: "Add Environment Variable"
   - Name: `KHALTI_SECRET_KEY`
   - Value: `test_secret_key_xxxxx...`

3. Test Khalti payment flow

---

### **Issue #3: Cart Not Clearing (MINOR)**

**Status:** Will auto-fix when orders are created

**Current Behavior:** Cart stays full after successful payment

**Why:** Cart clearing happens in order creation logic

**Fix:** Once order-worker processes jobs, cart will clear automatically

---

## **📋 VERIFICATION QUERIES**

### **Check Pending Jobs:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  status,
  payload->>'payment_intent_id' as payment_intent_id,
  attempts,
  last_error,
  created_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at))/60 as minutes_ago
FROM job_queue
WHERE job_type = 'finalize_order'
  AND status IN ('pending', 'processing')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Check Recent Orders:**
```sql
SELECT 
  o.order_number,
  o.status,
  o.total_cents,
  o.payment_intent_id,
  o.created_at,
  COUNT(oi.id) as item_count
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY o.id
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC;
```

### **Check Payment Intents:**
```sql
SELECT 
  payment_intent_id,
  provider,
  status,
  amount_cents,
  external_transaction_id,
  created_at
FROM payment_intents
WHERE provider IN ('esewa', 'khalti')
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## **✅ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Right Now (5 minutes):**

1. **Test the trigger script:**
   ```powershell
   cd d:\kb-stylish
   .\scripts\trigger-order-worker.ps1
   ```

2. **Check if orders appear:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau/editor/orders
   - Look for 2 new orders created

3. **Check Edge Function logs:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau/logs/edge-functions
   - Filter by: `order-worker`
   - Look for processing logs

### **Today (30 minutes):**

4. **Add Khalti secret key** to Supabase

5. **Set up automatic worker trigger:**
   - Decide on cron strategy
   - Implement chosen solution

6. **Test full payment flows:**
   - Test eSewa end-to-end
   - Test Khalti end-to-end
   - Verify cart clearing
