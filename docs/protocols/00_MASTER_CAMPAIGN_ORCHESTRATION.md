## 🎯 CAMPAIGN EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Recommended Order

**Phase 1: Foundation Campaigns (Weeks 1-4)**
1. Customer Journey (Week 1-2)
   - Most critical for revenue
   - Highest user volume
   - Sets baseline quality standard

2. Vendor Journey (Week 3-4)
   - Required for marketplace functionality
   - Impacts customer experience indirectly
   - Critical for seller satisfaction

**Phase 2: Service Campaigns (Weeks 5-6)**
3. Stylist Journey (Week 5-6)
   - Unique value proposition
   - Booking system complexity
   - Revenue driver

**Phase 3: Platform Operations (Weeks 7-8)**
4. Admin Journey (Week 7-8)
   - Platform management
   - Moderation and governance
   - Support operations

### Parallel Work Strategy

**Can be parallelized** (if multiple AI instances available):
- AI working on Doctrine for Campaign 2 while Human tests Campaign 1
- AI working on Restoration while Human reviews Doctrine

**Cannot be parallelized**:
- Human testing (you can only test one thing at a time)
- Bug fixes that affect multiple campaigns (wait for all to discover issues)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### For AI Engineers

1. **Follow the Protocols Religiously**
   - Don't skip phases
   - Don't assume anything works
   - Verify everything via MCP

2. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**
   - P0 issues MUST be fixed before anything else
   - No shortcuts on security or data integrity
   - Performance is non-negotiable

3. **Document Everything**
   - Every question answered
   - Every issue found
   - Every fix implemented
   - Every test executed

4. **Think Like Users, Not Engineers**
   - UX matters as much as code quality
   - Error messages must be helpful
   - Loading states must exist
   - Nothing should be confusing

### For Human Orchestrators

1. **Be the Final Judge**
   - AI will make the system excellent, but you certify it
   - If something feels wrong, it probably is
   - Trust your instincts on UX issues

2. **Test Adversarially**
   - Try to break things
   - Use weird inputs
   - Click rapidly
   - Refresh at wrong times
   - Test on slow connections

3. **Document Everything You Find**
   - Screenshots are essential
   - Reproduction steps must be clear
   - Severity assessment helps AI prioritize

4. **Be Thorough, Not Fast**
   - Rushing through verification defeats the purpose
   - One missed P0 bug can cause production outage
   - Quality over speed

---

## 🎓 BEST PRACTICES & LESSONS LEARNED

### AI Best Practices

1. **Start with Live System, Not Code**
   - Always query MCP first
   - Migration files can be outdated
   - Live database is source of truth

2. **Generate Examples, Not Placeholders**
   - Don't say "[Generate 20 more questions]"
   - Actually generate all 20 questions
   - Quality in = Quality out

3. **Test Fixes Immediately**
   - Don't batch all fixes then test
   - One fix → Test → Next fix
   - Prevents regression cascades

4. **Over-Communicate with Human**
   - Write detailed verification guides
   - Include screenshots in docs
   - Make human testing trivial

### Human Best Practices

1. **Use Real Data**
   - Don't test with "test@test.com"
   - Use realistic names, addresses, products
   - Tests edge cases in data validation

2. **Test on Multiple Devices**
   - Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Mobile (iOS, Android)
   - Tablet
   - Different screen sizes

3. **Clear State Between Tests**
   - Fresh browser session
   - Clear localStorage
   - New user account if needed
   - Prevents false passes

4. **Think Like a New User**
   - Pretend you've never seen the app
   - Follow intuition, not documentation
   - Note anything confusing

## 📞 ESCALATION & SUPPORT

### When AI Gets Stuck

**AI should ask human if**:
- Business logic is ambiguous
- Multiple valid solutions exist
- Breaking changes are required
- Access to external services needed
- Human judgment required on trade-offs

**AI should NOT ask human if**:
- Code is complex (analyze it)
- Tests are failing (debug it)
- Documentation is missing (infer from code)
- More time needed (take the time)

### When Human Finds Blocker

**Escalate immediately if**:
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data loss scenario found
- Payment system broken
- Core functionality completely broken
- Widespread regression across multiple features

**Log for next iteration if**:
- Minor UX issue
- Edge case bug
- Non-critical performance issue
- Documentation gap
- Nice-to-have feature missing
