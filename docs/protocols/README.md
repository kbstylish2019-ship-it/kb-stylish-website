## 🎓 Key Principles

### 1. Total System Consciousness
Before asking a single question, achieve complete understanding of the domain across all layers (DB, API, Frontend, Edge Functions).

### 2. MCP-First Verification
Always verify against the **live database** via MCP tools. Migration files can be outdated. Live system is source of truth.

### 3. Question Quality Over Quantity
Each question must be:
- **Specific**: Testable with concrete evidence
- **Failure-Focused**: Assumes adversarial conditions
- **Layered**: Spans architecture, implementation, runtime
- **User-Impact Oriented**: Traces to user consequences

### 4. Surgical Fixes Only
Every fix must be:
- **Minimal**: Smallest change that solves the problem
- **Tested**: Unit, integration, and manual verification
- **Reversible**: Clear rollback plan
- **Regression-Proof**: Adjacent functionality verified

### 5. Human as Final Judge
AI does 95% of the work, but humans make the final certification decision. If it doesn't feel right to the human, it's not ready.
