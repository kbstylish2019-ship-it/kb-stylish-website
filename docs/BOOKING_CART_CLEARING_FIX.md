## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved a critical bug where booking reservations were not being cleared from the cart after successful checkout, even though the payment included both products and services. The issue was traced to the `process_order_with_occ` database function only processing products but ignoring booking reservations.

---

## Problem Statement

### Observed Behavior
When a user checked out with a **mixed cart** (containing both products and booking reservations):
- ✅ Payment correctly included totals for **both** products and services
- ✅ Products were cleared from `cart_items` table
- ❌ **Booking reservations remained in the cart** (not cleared from `booking_reservations` table)
- ❌ Booking reservations were **not converted to confirmed bookings**
- ❌ User saw stale booking items after successful checkout

### User Impact
- Customers confused by services remaining in cart after payment
- Potential for duplicate bookings if user tried to checkout again
- Poor UX with "ghost" items in cart
- No confirmed bookings created in the system

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Path
1. Verified payment flow correctly calculated totals (products + bookings) ✅
2. Verified `create-order-intent` Edge Function included booking totals ✅
3. Verified `payment-callback` correctly triggered order worker ✅
4. **FOUND**: `order-worker` calls `process_order_with_occ` function ⚠️
5. **ROOT CAUSE**: `process_order_with_occ` only processes products from `cart_items`, completely ignoring `booking_reservations` table 🔴

### Code Evidence
**Before Fix** (`process_order_with_occ` lines 232-242):
```sql
-- Count items we need to process
SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_items_needed
FROM cart_items
WHERE cart_id = v_cart_id;

-- Calculate total from cart (convert to cents for orders table)
SELECT SUM(ci.quantity * pv.price) * 100
INTO v_total_amount
FROM cart_items ci
JOIN product_variants pv ON pv.id = ci.variant_id
WHERE ci.cart_id = v_cart_id;
```

**Problem**: Only queried `cart_items`, never touched `booking_reservations`.

---

## Solution Architecture

### Design Decisions
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep products and bookings as distinct entities (per THE GREAT DECOUPLING architecture)
2. **Idempotency**: Maintain transaction safety with proper error handling
3. **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing approach - if any booking fails, entire order fails
4. **Audit Trail**: Preserve booking confirmation records for compliance

### Implementation Strategy
Updated `process_order_with_occ` to handle **dual-entity carts**:

#### Phase A: Products Processing (Existing)
- Query `cart_items` for product count and totals
- Decrement inventory with OCC predicates
- Create `order_items` records
- Clear `cart_items` on success

#### Phase B: Bookings Processing (NEW)
- Query `booking_reservations` for active reservations
- Calculate booking totals from `price_cents`
- Call `confirm_booking_reservation()` for each reservation
  - Creates confirmed `bookings` record
  - Marks reservation as 'confirmed'
  - Links to payment intent
- Clear confirmed `booking_reservations` on success

#### Phase C: Combined Validation
- Track separate counts: `v_product_items_processed`, `v_booking_items_processed`
- Validate **both** match expected counts
- Raise exception if any discrepancy (triggers rollback)

## Technical Changes

### Migration: `20250925000000_fix_booking_cart_clearing.sql`

**Function Updated**: `public.process_order_with_occ(TEXT, UUID)`

#### New Variables Added
```sql
v_product_items_needed INT;      -- Count of products in cart
v_booking_items_needed INT;      -- Count of booking reservations
v_product_items_processed INT;   -- Products successfully processed
v_booking_items_processed INT;   -- Bookings successfully confirmed
v_product_total_cents INT;       -- Product subtotal
v_booking_total_cents INT;       -- Booking subtotal
v_booking_reservation RECORD;    -- Loop variable for bookings
v_confirm_result JSONB;          -- Result from confirm_booking_reservation
```

#### Key Logic Changes

**1. Dual Counting**
```sql
-- Count products
SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_product_items_needed
FROM cart_items
WHERE cart_id = v_cart_id;

-- Count bookings
SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_booking_items_needed
FROM booking_reservations
WHERE customer_user_id = v_user_id
    AND status = 'reserved'
    AND expires_at > NOW();

v_items_needed := v_product_items_needed + v_booking_items_needed;
```

**2. Dual Total Calculation**
```sql
-- Product total
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(ci.quantity * pv.price) * 100, 0)
INTO v_product_total_cents
FROM cart_items ci
JOIN product_variants pv ON pv.id = ci.variant_id
WHERE ci.cart_id = v_cart_id;

-- Booking total
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(price_cents), 0)
INTO v_booking_total_cents
FROM booking_reservations
WHERE customer_user_id = v_user_id
    AND status = 'reserved'
    AND expires_at > NOW();

v_total_amount := v_product_total_cents + v_booking_total_cents;
```

**3. Booking Confirmation Loop**
```sql
IF v_booking_items_needed > 0 THEN
    FOR v_booking_reservation IN
        SELECT id, price_cents
        FROM booking_reservations
        WHERE customer_user_id = v_user_id
            AND status = 'reserved'
            AND expires_at > NOW()
        ORDER BY id
    LOOP
        SELECT public.confirm_booking_reservation(
            v_booking_reservation.id,
            p_payment_intent_id
        ) INTO v_confirm_result;
        
        IF NOT (v_confirm_result->>'success')::boolean THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'Failed to confirm booking reservation %: %', 
                v_booking_reservation.id,
                v_confirm_result->>'error';
        END IF;
        
        v_booking_items_processed := v_booking_items_processed + 1;
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Validate all bookings confirmed
    IF v_booking_items_processed != v_booking_items_needed THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Failed to confirm all bookings: only % of % booking items could be processed', 
            v_booking_items_processed, v_booking_items_needed;
    END IF;
END IF;
```

**4. Booking Reservation Cleanup**
```sql
-- Clear confirmed booking reservations (now in bookings table)
DELETE FROM booking_reservations 
WHERE customer_user_id = v_user_id 
    AND status = 'confirmed';
```

**5. Enhanced Metadata**
```sql
metadata: jsonb_build_object(
    'webhook_event_id', p_webhook_event_id,
    'payment_provider', v_payment_intent.provider,
    'payment_metadata', v_payment_intent.provider_response,
    'product_items_count', v_product_items_needed,  -- NEW
    'booking_items_count', v_booking_items_needed   -- NEW
)
```

**6. Enhanced Return Data**
```sql
RETURN jsonb_build_object(
    'success', true,
    'order_id', v_order_id,
    'items_processed', v_items_processed,
    'product_items_processed', v_product_items_processed,  -- NEW
    'booking_items_processed', v_booking_items_processed,  -- NEW
    'total_cents', v_total_amount::INTEGER,
    'user_id', v_user_id
);
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Products Only
- **Given**: Cart with 2 products, no bookings
- **Expected**: Products cleared, no booking processing
- **Status**: ✅ Backward compatible

#### Scenario 2: Bookings Only
- **Given**: Cart with 2 booking reservations, no products
- **Expected**: Bookings confirmed and cleared
- **Status**: ✅ New functionality

#### Scenario 3: Mixed Cart
- **Given**: Cart with 2 products + 1 booking
- **Expected**: Both products and booking processed and cleared
- **Status**: ✅ Primary fix target

#### Scenario 4: Expired Bookings
- **Given**: Expired booking reservations in cart
- **Expected**: Only active reservations processed
- **Status**: ✅ Proper filtering with `expires_at > NOW()`

#### Scenario 5: Booking Confirmation Failure
- **Given**: Booking reservation conflicts with another booking
- **Expected**: Entire order fails, transaction rolled back
- **Status**: ✅ Atomic transaction handling

### Verification Commands

```sql
-- Check if booking reservations are cleared after checkout
SELECT * FROM booking_reservations 
WHERE customer_user_id = '<user_id>' 
AND status = 'confirmed';
-- Should return 0 rows after successful checkout

-- Check if bookings were created
SELECT * FROM bookings 
WHERE customer_user_id = '<user_id>' 
AND payment_intent_id = '<payment_intent_id>';
-- Should show confirmed bookings

-- Check order metadata
SELECT metadata FROM orders 
WHERE payment_intent_id = '<payment_intent_id>';
-- Should include product_items_count and booking_items_count
```

---

## Deployment

### Migration Applied
- ✅ Migration file: `20250925000000_fix_booking_cart_clearing.sql`
- ✅ Applied via Supabase MCP: `mcp1_apply_migration`
- ✅ Project: `poxjcaogjupsplrcliau`
- ✅ Status: **LIVE IN PRODUCTION**

### Rollback Plan (If Needed)
If critical issues arise, revert to previous function version:
```sql
-- Restore from backup migration: 20250920092000_phoenix_protocol_fixes.sql
-- Lines 179-408 contain the original process_order_with_occ function
```

### Monitoring
Watch for these metrics post-deployment:
- **Order completion rate**: Should increase for mixed carts
- **Booking confirmation rate**: Should match payment success rate
- **Cart items after checkout**: Should be 0 for both products and bookings
- **Customer complaints**: Should decrease regarding "stuck" bookings

---

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ❌ Mixed carts left booking reservations in cart
- ❌ Booking reservations never converted to confirmed bookings
- ❌ Poor user experience with stale cart data
- ❌ Risk of double-booking attempts

### After Fix
- ✅ Mixed carts fully cleared after successful checkout
- ✅ Booking reservations properly converted to confirmed bookings
- ✅ Clean cart state post-checkout
- ✅ Accurate booking records in database
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns maintained (per THE GREAT DECOUPLING)
- ✅ Enhanced metadata for better order tracking

## Conclusion

This fix completes the booking checkout integration by ensuring that booking reservations are properly processed during order finalization. The solution maintains architectural separation between products and bookings while providing a unified transaction experience. All booking reservations are now correctly converted to confirmed bookings and cleared from the cart, matching the behavior of product items.

**Status**: ✅ **BUG FIXED - DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**
