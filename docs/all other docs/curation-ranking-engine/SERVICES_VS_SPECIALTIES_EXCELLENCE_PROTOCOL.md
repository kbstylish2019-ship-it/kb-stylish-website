# üéØ SERVICES vs SPECIALTIES - UNIVERSAL AI EXCELLENCE PROTOCOL

**Date**: October 17, 2025, 9:00 PM NPT  
**Task**: Determine relationship between Services and Specialties in onboarding  
**Protocol**: UNIVERSAL_AI_EXCELLENCE_PROTOCOL v2.0  

---

## PHASE 1: CODEBASE IMMERSION ‚úÖ

### 1.1 Architecture Understanding

**SERVICES** (Admin-managed via `/admin/services`):
- Created by admin in `services` table
- Examples: "Bridal Makeup", "Hair Color", "Haircut & Style", "Manicure", "Facial Treatment"
- Schema: `id, name, slug, description, category, duration_minutes, base_price_cents`
- Categories: `hair`, `makeup`, `nails`, `spa`, `consultation`
- **Junction Table**: `stylist_services` (many-to-many)
  - `stylist_user_id`, `service_id`, `custom_price_cents`, `custom_duration_minutes`
  - Allows stylist to offer service at custom price/duration

**SPECIALTIES** (Freeform text array):
- Stored in `stylist_profiles.specialties` as TEXT[]
- Examples: `['Hair Coloring', 'Bridal Styling']`, `['haircolor']`, `['hair', 'color', 'body']`
- **NOT in onboarding wizard** ‚ùå
- Inconsistent formatting
- One stylist has `[]` (empty array)

### 1.2 Current State Verification (Live Database)

**Services Table**:
```
Hair Color - NPR 3500, 120 min
Haircut & Style - NPR 1500, 60 min
Bridal Makeup - NPR 5000, 90 min
Manicure - NPR 800, 45 min
Facial Treatment - NPR 2000, 60 min
```

**Stylist Services Assignments**:
```
Sarah Johnson: 5 services (Haircut, Color, Bridal, Manicure, Facial)
Shishir bhusal: 5 services (Haircut, Color, Bridal, Manicure, Facial)
rabindra sah: 5 services (Haircut, Color, Bridal, Manicure, Facial)
sara kami: 4 services (Bridal, Facial, Color, Haircut)
test stylish: 2 services (Bridal, Facial)
```

**Specialties Data**:
```
Sarah Johnson: ['Hair Coloring', 'Bridal Styling', 'Hair Extensions']
Shishir bhusal: ['haircolor']
rabindra sah: ['haircolor', 'bridalmakeup', 'bridal']
sara kami: ['hair', 'color', 'body']
test stylish: [] ‚ùå EMPTY
```

### 1.3 Existing Patterns

**Onboarding Flow** (`OnboardingWizardClient.tsx`):
```
Step 1: User Selection
Step 2: Verification (Background check, ID, Training, MFA)
Step 3: Profile Setup (display_name, title, bio, years_experience, timezone)
Step 4: Services Selection ‚úÖ (Admin selects which services stylist can offer)
Step 5: Review & Complete
```

**‚ùå SPECIALTIES NOT IN ONBOARDING** - This is the core problem!

### 1.4 User's Question

> "There are services thing is admin page, where admin actually can create services and then during onboarding he can select the services they can offer, should the specialities be different? What do they offer thing. Like if the admin wants to add another specialities than the actual dropdown what happens? How can he add one?"

**Key Concerns**:
1. Are Services and Specialties different concepts?
2. If admin wants to add new specialty, how?
3. Should specialties be managed like services?

## PHASE 2: THE 5-EXPERT PANEL CONSULTATION

### üë®‚Äçüíª Expert 1: Senior Security Architect

**Analysis**:
- Services are **admin-controlled** ‚úÖ (secure, validated, standardized)
- Specialties are **freeform text** ‚ùå (no validation, injection risk low but UX poor)
- User input should always be validated

**Recommendations**:
1. If specialties stay freeform ‚Üí Add input validation (max length, allowed characters)
2. Better: Make specialties predefined like services
3. Admin should control the "vocabulary" of specialties

**Security Score**: Services (9/10), Specialties (5/10)

---

### ‚ö° Expert 2: Performance Engineer

**Analysis**:
- TEXT[] array scan is slower than indexed foreign key lookup
- Services use indexed junction table (fast)
- Specialties stored as array (harder to query efficiently)

**Example Query Performance**:
```sql
-- FAST: Services (uses index)
SELECT * FROM stylists WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT stylist_user_id FROM stylist_services WHERE service_id = 'hair-color-uuid'
);

-- SLOW: Specialties (array containment)
SELECT * FROM stylists WHERE 'haircolor' = ANY(specialties);
```

**Recommendations**:
1. If filtering by specialty is common ‚Üí Convert to reference table
2. If display-only ‚Üí TEXT[] is fine
3. Services architecture is more scalable

**Performance Score**: Services (9/10), Specialties (6/10)

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Expert 3: Data Architect

**Analysis**:

**Services Architecture** (Ideal):
```
services (admin-managed)
  ‚Üì
stylist_services (junction table)
  ‚Üì
stylists (which services they offer)
```
- Normalized
- Referential integrity
- Admin-controlled vocabulary
- Can add new services dynamically

**Specialties Architecture** (Current):
```
stylists.specialties TEXT[]
```
- No referential integrity
- No controlled vocabulary
- Inconsistent data (`'Hair Coloring'` vs `'haircolor'`)
- Empty arrays possible

**Problem**: Specialties and Services are **overlapping concepts**!
- "Hair Coloring" is both a specialty AND a service
- "Bridal Makeup" is both a specialty AND a service

**Key Insight**: **SERVICES ALREADY CAPTURE SPECIALTIES!**

If a stylist offers "Bridal Makeup" service, they specialize in bridal makeup.  
If a stylist offers "Hair Coloring" service, they specialize in hair coloring.

**Recommendations**:
1. **Option A**: Remove specialties entirely (redundant with services)
2. **Option B**: Make specialties HIGH-LEVEL categories derived from services
   - Auto-compute: If stylist offers "Bridal Makeup" ‚Üí specialty = "Bridal"
   - If stylist offers "Hair Color" ‚Üí specialty = "Hair"
3. **Option C**: Create `specialty_types` table (like services) for admin control

**Data Quality Score**: Services (10/10), Specialties (3/10)

---

### üé® Expert 4: Frontend/UX Engineer

**Analysis**:

**User Journey - Customer Booking**:
1. Customer visits `/book-a-stylist`
2. Wants to filter: "Show me bridal specialists"
3. **Current**: Filters by service category (`category = 'makeup'` ‚Üí shows all makeup artists)
4. **Better**: Filter by specialty ("Bridal") ‚Üí shows only bridal specialists

**Display Hierarchy**:
```
Stylist Card:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Name: "Sarah Johnson"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title: "Senior Hair Stylist" (job title)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Specialties: "Bridal, Hair Coloring" (what they're known for)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Services: "Bridal Makeup, Hair Color, Extensions" (what they offer)
```

**UX Insight**: **Specialties = Marketing Tags**, **Services = Actual Offerings**

**Analogy**:
- Doctor's **specialty**: "Cardiology" (broad expertise area)
- Doctor's **services**: "ECG", "Stress Test", "Angioplasty" (specific procedures)

**Recommendations**:
1. Keep both concepts BUT make specialties high-level
2. Specialties for filtering/discovery ("Find a bridal specialist")
3. Services for booking ("Book Bridal Makeup - NPR 5000")

**UX Score**: Both concepts valuable IF implemented correctly

---

### üî¨ Expert 5: Principal Engineer (Integration & Systems)

**Analysis**:

**End-to-End Flow**:
```
Admin creates service "Bridal Makeup"
  ‚Üì
Admin onboards stylist
  ‚Üì
Admin selects services stylist can offer
  ‚Üì
Customer searches for "bridal specialist"
  ‚Üì
System shows stylists with bridal services
```

**Current Gap**: No specialty filtering exists!

**Integration Points**:
1. Admin services UI (`/admin/services`) ‚úÖ
2. Onboarding wizard (`/admin/stylists/onboard`) ‚úÖ Services, ‚ùå Specialties
3. Booking page (`/book-a-stylist`) ‚úÖ Service category filter
4. Stylist cards ‚Üí Display specialties ‚úÖ (but data inconsistent)

**Edge Cases**:
1. Admin wants to add "Barber" specialty but no "barbering" service exists
   - Solution: Create services first, specialties derive from them
2. Stylist offers 10 services but wants to highlight 3 key specialties
   - Solution: Let stylist/admin select "featured" services as specialties
3. Customer searches "extensions" but it's not a service category
   - Solution: Specialties help with search/SEO

**Recommendations**:
1. **Option A: Auto-derive specialties from services**
   - Simple, no new UI needed
   - Specialties = unique service categories stylist offers
   
2. **Option B: Admin selects specialty tags during onboarding**
   - More flexible
   - Requires new UI for specialty management (like services)

3. **Option C: Remove specialties column, use services only**
   - Simplest
   - Less flexible for marketing/SEO

**Systems Integration Score**: Need clear relationship between concepts

---

## PHASE 3: CODEBASE CONSISTENCY CHECK

### 3.1 Similar Patterns in Codebase

**Products have similar hierarchy**:
```
products.category ‚Üí High-level (e.g., "ethnic", "streetwear")
products.tags ‚Üí Marketing tags (e.g., "trending", "new-arrival")
```

**Stylists SHOULD have**:
```
stylist_profiles.specialty_category ‚Üí High-level (e.g., "Bridal", "Hair", "Makeup")
stylist_services ‚Üí Specific offerings (e.g., "Bridal Makeup - NPR 5000")
```

### 3.2 Anti-Patterns Detected

‚ùå **Current specialties implementation violates**:
1. **DRY Principle** - Data duplicated in services
2. **Single Source of Truth** - Two places for same info
3. **Data Integrity** - No referential integrity
4. **Consistency** - No controlled vocabulary

---

## PHASE 4: SOLUTION BLUEPRINT

### 4.1 Approach Selection

**‚úÖ SELECTED: Hybrid Approach (Option B)**

**Why**:
- Specialties serve a different purpose than services (marketing vs offerings)
- Need admin control (like services)
- Should derive FROM services but be admin-curated
- Solves the "what if admin wants to add new specialty" question

### 4.2 Proposed Solution Architecture

#### **NEW: `specialty_types` Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.specialty_types (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- "Bridal Specialist"
    slug TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,   -- "bridal"
    category TEXT,                -- "makeup" or "hair" or "nails"
    description TEXT,
    icon TEXT,                    -- Icon name for UI
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### **NEW: `stylist_specialties` Junction Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.stylist_specialties (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    stylist_user_id UUID REFERENCES stylist_profiles(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    specialty_type_id UUID REFERENCES specialty_types(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,  -- Highlight this specialty
    display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(stylist_user_id, specialty_type_id)
);
```

#### **DEPRECATE**: `stylist_profiles.specialties TEXT[]`
- Keep column for backwards compatibility
- Mark as deprecated in schema
- Migrate data to new tables
- Remove in future version

### 4.3 Implementation Plan

**Phase A: Database Setup**
1. Create `specialty_types` table
2. Create `stylist_specialties` junction table
3. Seed with standard specialties:
   ```
   - Bridal Specialist (makeup category)
   - Hair Coloring Expert (hair category)
   - Extensions Specialist (hair category)
   - Nail Artist (nails category)
   - Spa Therapist (spa category)
   - Men's Grooming (hair category)
   ```
4. Create migration to copy existing specialties to new tables

**Phase B: Admin UI**
1. Create `/admin/curation/specialties` page (like services)
2. Admin can add/edit/deactivate specialty types
3. Update onboarding wizard Step 3:
   - After services selection
   - Multi-select dropdown for specialties
   - Auto-suggest based on selected services
   - Min 1, Max 5 specialties

**Phase C: Frontend Integration**
1. Update booking page filter to include specialties
2. Update stylist cards to show specialty badges
3. Add specialty chips to stylist profile pages

**Phase D: Migration & Cleanup**
1. Run data migration
2. Deprecate old specialties column
3. Update all queries to use new tables

### 4.4 Data Migration Strategy

```sql
-- Migrate existing data
INSERT INTO specialty_types (name, slug, category) VALUES
  ('Hair Coloring', 'hair-coloring', 'hair'),
  ('Bridal Styling', 'bridal-styling', 'makeup'),
  ('Hair Extensions', 'hair-extensions', 'hair');

-- Map old specialties to new types (fuzzy matching)
INSERT INTO stylist_specialties (stylist_user_id, specialty_type_id)
SELECT 
    sp.user_id,
    st.id
FROM stylist_profiles sp
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(sp.specialties) AS spec
JOIN specialty_types st ON (
    LOWER(st.name) = LOWER(spec) OR
    LOWER(st.slug) = LOWER(spec) OR
    LOWER(REPLACE(st.name, ' ', '')) = LOWER(spec)
)
WHERE sp.specialties IS NOT NULL AND array_length(sp.specialties, 1) > 0;
```
