## 🎯 **KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS**

### 1. Specialties ARE Different from Services ✅
- **Specialties** = Expertise areas (marketing, discovery, SEO)
  - Example: "Bridal Specialist", "Hair Coloring Expert"
  - Used for filtering and discovery
  - Admin-managed vocabulary
  
- **Services** = Bookable offerings (with prices and durations)
  - Example: "Bridal Makeup - NPR 5000 - 90 min"
  - Used for actual booking transactions
  - Admin-managed pricing

### 2. Admin Controls Vocabulary ✅
- Admin can add/edit/deactivate specialty types
- Similar to how services are managed
- No freeform text input (data integrity)

### 3. Onboarding Integration ✅
- Stylists MUST select 1-5 specialties during onboarding
- Auto-suggest based on selected services (smart defaults)
- First specialty is marked as "primary"

### 4. Dual Filtering System ✅
- Booking page shows both:
  - Service category filters (broad: "hair", "makeup")
  - Specialty filters (specific: "Hair Coloring Expert")
- Different visual styling for clarity
