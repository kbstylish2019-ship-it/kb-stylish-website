# üî• CRITICAL FIX: Curation Engine 500 Errors

**Date**: October 17, 2025, 12:35 PM NPT  
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - REQUIRES MANUAL DEPLOYMENT  

---

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ‚úÖ

The Edge Function `get-curated-content` was deployed with **`verify_jwt: true`** but it should be **`false`** for public curation data.

**Impact**:
- Frontend sends anon key  
- Edge Function rejects it because JWT verification is enabled
- Results in 500 errors for `fetch_trending_products` and `fetch_recommendations`

---

## FIXES APPLIED ‚úÖ

### 1. Database Function Type Mismatch - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: `get_product_recommendations` returned `VARCHAR(200)` but expected `TEXT`
- **Solution**: Dropped and recreated function with explicit `CAST()` statements
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING (returns empty because no recommendations exist yet)

### 2. Edge Function JWT Verification - CONFIG CREATED ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Edge Function has `verify_jwt: true` 
- **Solution**: Created `supabase/functions/get-curated-content/config.toml` with `verify_jwt = false`
- **Status**: ‚è≥ REQUIRES MANUAL DEPLOYMENT

---

## üö® MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED

You must manually deploy the Edge Function with the `--no-verify-jwt` flag:

```bash
cd d:\kb-stylish

# Deploy with NO JWT verification (for public access)
supabase functions deploy get-curated-content --no-verify-jwt --project-ref poxjcaogjupsplrcliau

# Verify it deployed correctly
supabase functions list
```

**Expected Output**: `verify_jwt: false`

---

## WHY MANUAL DEPLOYMENT?

The Supabase MCP `deploy_edge_function` tool doesn't support the `--no-verify-jwt` flag. You need to use the CLI directly.

The `config.toml` file I created will ensure future deployments respect this setting.

## VERIFICATION STEPS

After deployment, test:

```bash
# Test 1: Trending Products
curl "https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-curated-content?action=fetch_trending_products&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Expected: 200 OK with product data

# Test 2: Recommendations
curl "https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-curated-content?action=fetch_recommendations&product_id=SOME_PRODUCT_ID&limit=4" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Expected: 200 OK (empty array is fine - no recommendations exist yet)

# Test 3: Featured Brands  
curl "https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-curated-content?action=fetch_featured_brands&limit=6" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Expected: 200 OK with Urban Threads brand
```

## NEXT STEPS AFTER DEPLOYMENT

1. ‚úÖ Refresh homepage ‚Üí Trending Products should appear
2. ‚úÖ Visit product page ‚Üí "Complete the Look" should appear (empty for now)
3. ‚úÖ Check featured brands section ‚Üí "Urban Threads" should appear
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Add product recommendations via admin UI
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Backfill trending scores for products with orders

2. ‚úÖ Database function `get_product_recommendations` - FIXED (dropped/recreated)
3. ‚è≥ Edge Function deployment - PENDING YOUR MANUAL ACTION
