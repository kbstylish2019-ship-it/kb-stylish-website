## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

### Step 1: Apply Migration

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
cd supabase

# Apply migration
supabase db push

# Or locally:
supabase migration up
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration

```sql
-- Check table created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM booking_status_history;

-- Check functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('update_booking_status', 'add_stylist_notes', 'validate_status_transition');

-- Test FSM
SELECT 
    validate_status_transition('confirmed', 'completed') as should_be_true,
    validate_status_transition('completed', 'cancelled') as should_be_false;
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Deploy (Vercel/Netlify)
vercel deploy --prod
```

### Step 4: Test

```
1. Login as stylist
2. Go to /stylist/dashboard
3. Click "Manage Booking" on a confirmed booking
4. Mark as completed
5. Verify status updated
6. Go to /stylist/bookings
7. Test filters and search
```

## 🎨 FEATURES

### Status Management

**Valid Transitions:**
```
pending → confirmed | cancelled
confirmed → in_progress | completed | cancelled | no_show
in_progress → completed | cancelled
```

**Terminal States:** completed, cancelled, no_show

**Validations:**
- Can't mark completed before start time
- Can't mark no-show before appointment
- Can't start service >30 mins early
- Cancellation requires reason (min 3 chars)

### Audit Trail

Every change logs:
- Who (user_id)
- When (timestamp)
- What (old → new status)
- Why (reason)
- How (actor_role)

**Immutable:** append-only, no updates/deletes

### Stylist Notes

- Append-only with timestamps
- Private (only stylist can see)
- Max 2000 characters
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]\n{notes}`

### Bookings List

**Filters:** All, Upcoming, Past, Completed, Cancelled  
**Search:** By customer name  
**Display:** Full booking details + actions

## 🛡️ SECURITY

### Authentication ✅
- Multi-layer (page → API → RPC)
- Token verification
- Role checks (stylist required)

### Authorization ✅
- Ownership verification
- RLS policies
- SECURITY DEFINER with search_path

### Input Validation ✅
- Type checking
- Length limits
- Whitelist validation
- SQL injection prevention

### Concurrency ✅
- FOR UPDATE NOWAIT
- Lock timeout handling
- Idempotent operations

### Compliance ✅
- GDPR Article 30 (audit trail)
- Immutable logs
- Actor tracking
- IP address logging (optional)

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Migration Fails

```bash
# Check current migration version
supabase db version

# Reset local database
supabase db reset

# Try again
supabase migration up
```

### RPC Function Not Found

```sql
-- Check function exists
SELECT routine_name, routine_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%booking%';

-- If missing, re-apply migration
```

### TypeScript Errors

```bash
# Rebuild type definitions
npm run build

# Check imports
# Ensure BookingActionsModal and BookingsListClient are properly imported
```

### Status Update Fails

Check:
1. User has stylist role
2. Booking belongs to stylist
3. Status transition is valid
4. Timing rules met
5. Reason provided (if cancellation)

## 📞 SUPPORT

### Common Issues

**Q: Can't mark booking as completed**  
A: Check if booking start time has passed. Can't mark future bookings as completed.

**Q: Status change returns CONCURRENT_UPDATE**  
A: Another user/tab is updating the same booking. Wait and try again.

**Q: Notes not saving**  
A: Check length <2000 characters. Check ownership.

**Q: Bookings list empty**  
A: Check filter selection. Try "All" filter. Verify bookings exist for this stylist.
