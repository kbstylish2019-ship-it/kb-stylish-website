# üìñ How to Use the Universal AI Excellence Protocol

**TL;DR**: Paste `UNIVERSAL_AI_EXCELLENCE_PROMPT.md` into ANY new AI chat before starting work to ensure FAANG-level quality.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The **Universal AI Excellence Protocol** forces AI assistants to:
1. **Deeply understand** your codebase before making changes
2. **Think through solutions** using a 5-expert panel approach
3. **Design blueprints** before writing code
4. **Review critically** like a FAANG senior engineer
5. **Ensure consistency** with existing patterns
6. **Deliver enterprise-grade** quality

**Result**: No more inconsistent code, architectural drift, or broken patterns.

## üé≠ The 5-Expert Panel

Every solution is reviewed by these virtual experts:

1. **üë®‚Äçüíª Security Architect** - Finds vulnerabilities, enforces least-privilege
2. **‚ö° Performance Engineer** - Optimizes for scale, prevents N+1 queries
3. **üóÑÔ∏è Data Architect** - Ensures schema integrity, safe migrations
4. **üé® UX Engineer** - Validates user experience, accessibility
5. **üî¨ Principal Engineer** - Reviews integration, edge cases, systems thinking

**Why This Works**: Each expert has different priorities and catches issues others miss.

## üìö KB Stylish Specific Patterns

The protocol includes KB Stylish-specific context:

### Authentication Pattern
```typescript
// ALWAYS use dual-client pattern in Edge Functions
const { userClient, serviceClient } = createDualClients(authHeader);
const user = await verifyUser(authHeader, userClient);
```

### Database Functions
```sql
-- Public schema = SECURITY INVOKER (inherits user RLS)
CREATE FUNCTION public.get_vendor_stats()
RETURNS jsonb
SECURITY INVOKER
SET search_path = public, metrics, pg_temp
AS $$...$$;

-- Private schema = SECURITY DEFINER (bypasses RLS, must self-defend)
CREATE FUNCTION private.get_admin_stats(p_user_id uuid)
RETURNS jsonb  
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = private, public, pg_temp
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Self-defense: Verify admin role
  IF NOT public.user_has_role(p_user_id, 'admin') THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Access denied';
  END IF;
  ...
END;
$$;
```

### Edge Function Structure
```typescript
// supabase/functions/function-name/index.ts
import "jsr:@supabase/functions-js/edge-runtime.d.ts";
import { getCorsHeaders } from '../_shared/cors.ts';
import { createDualClients, verifyUser, errorResponse } from '../_shared/auth.ts';

Deno.serve(async (req: Request) => {
  const cors = getCorsHeaders(req.headers.get('Origin'));
  
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    return new Response('ok', { headers: cors });
  }
  
  const authHeader = req.headers.get('Authorization');
  const { userClient, serviceClient } = createDualClients(authHeader);
  const user = await verifyUser(authHeader, userClient);
  
  if (!user) {
    return errorResponse('Unauthorized', 'AUTH_REQUIRED', 401, cors);
  }
  
  // Your logic here
});
```

## üéì Real Example: Week 1 Metrics Pipeline

### Bad Approach (Without Protocol) ‚ùå
```
User: Add metrics worker to update dashboards in real-time

AI: Sure! Here's the code:
[Dumps 500 lines of code]

Result: 
- Doesn't integrate with existing order-worker
- Uses different naming convention
- Missing error handling
- Not idempotent (double-counting possible)
- No tests
- Breaks existing patterns
```

### Good Approach (With Protocol) ‚úÖ
```
User: Please read UNIVERSAL_AI_EXCELLENCE_PROMPT.md first.
Then implement Week 1 metrics pipeline per GOVERNANCE_ENGINE_NEXT_STEPS.md

AI: [Phase 1] Reading architecture docs...
    Found existing order-worker uses job_queue pattern
    Found existing metrics schema with vendor_daily, platform_daily
    Found backfill script as reference implementation
    
    [Phase 2] Expert Panel:
    - Security: Need to validate user_id in metrics update
    - Performance: Use ON CONFLICT for idempotency
    - Data: Must maintain consistency with platform_daily
    - UX: Dashboard should show <1 min lag
    - Systems: Integrate with existing job_queue pattern
    
    [Phase 4] Blueprint:
    - Modify order-worker to enqueue metrics jobs
    - Create metrics-worker handler for job_type='update_metrics'
    - Reuse existing upsert pattern from backfill
    - Add reconciliation job for drift correction
    
    [Phase 5] Review findings:
    - Security: ‚úÖ Uses service_role client
    - Performance: ‚úÖ Idempotent upserts, no deadlocks
    - Data: ‚úÖ Maintains referential integrity
    
    [Phase 8] Implementation:
    [Clean, consistent code that matches existing patterns]
    
Result:
- Integrates perfectly with existing code
- Follows all existing patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Idempotent and scalable
- Tests included
- No architectural drift
```

## üîç How It Prevents Common Issues

### Issue: Hardcoded Values
```
‚ùå Without Protocol:
const orderId = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001';

‚úÖ With Protocol (Phase 3 catches this):
"Anti-Pattern Detection: Hardcoded UUID found"
‚Üí Use actual order from database or environment variable
```

### Issue: SQL Injection
```
‚ùå Without Protocol:
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;

‚úÖ With Protocol (Phase 2 Security Expert catches this):
"Security vulnerability: SQL injection possible"
‚Üí Use parameterized queries or RPC functions
```

### Issue: Missing RLS
```
‚ùå Without Protocol:
CREATE TABLE sensitive_data (...);

‚úÖ With Protocol (Phase 2 Security + Phase 3 Consistency catch this):
"Missing RLS policy - all KB Stylish tables have RLS enabled"
‚Üí Add ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY and appropriate policies
```

### Issue: Performance Killer
```
‚ùå Without Protocol:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = '...';
-- Full table scan on 10M rows

‚úÖ With Protocol (Phase 2 Performance catches this):
"Missing index on orders(user_id) - will not scale"
‚Üí CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
```

## üö® Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Skipping Phase 1
```
"I already know the codebase, let me just code"
‚Üí Result: Misses existing helper functions, duplicates code
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Ignoring Expert Feedback
```
"Performance Expert says this won't scale, but it works now"
‚Üí Result: Production outage at 10K users
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Coding Before Blueprint Approval
```
"Let me code a quick prototype first"
‚Üí Result: Prototype becomes production code with all its flaws
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Skipping Phase 9 Review
```
"Tests pass, ship it"
‚Üí Result: Edge cases not tested, breaks in production
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Checklist Mode
Copy the checklist from the protocol and check off items as you go:
```markdown
- [x] Phase 1: Codebase Immersion
- [x] Phase 2: Expert Panel
- [ ] Phase 3: Consistency Check
...
```

### Tip 2: Document Expert Findings
Save expert feedback in a `DESIGN.md` file for future reference:
```markdown
## Security Expert Findings
- Must validate user owns resource before deletion
- Need rate limiting on public endpoints

## Performance Expert Findings  
- Add index on (vendor_id, created_at)
- Cache results for 60 seconds
```

### Tip 3: Iterate on Blueprints
Phase 6 is for revising based on feedback. Don't skip it:
```
Blueprint v1 ‚Üí Expert Review ‚Üí Issues Found
Blueprint v2 ‚Üí Expert Re-Review ‚Üí More Issues
Blueprint v3 ‚Üí Expert Approval ‚Üí Proceed to Phase 7
```

### Tip 4: Use Phase 10 Liberally
If you find bugs after implementation, go back to Phase 10:
```
Implementation Done ‚Üí Bug Found in Testing
‚Üí Back to Phase 10: Root cause analysis
‚Üí Fix + regression test
‚Üí Re-run Phase 9 review
```
