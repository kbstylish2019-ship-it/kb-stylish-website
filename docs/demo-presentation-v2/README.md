## How to present
1) Open with value in lakhs → 10–15 lakh anchor (not USD/millions)
2) Show Customer → Vendor → Stylist → Admin (progressive revelation)
3) Tie every demo moment to business impact (trust, speed, cost-saving)
4) Close with post-launch ops plan + soft upsell (monitoring retainer)

## Grounding (what this package relies on)
- Supabase migrations (encryption, advisory locks, cache invalidation, RLS)
- Trust Engine (purchase-verified reviews, sharded voting, moderation)
- Booking Engine (GiST range index, advisory locks, TTL/reservation cleanup)
- Metrics (vendor_daily/platform_daily, realtime cache)

Everything is cited in 10_APPENDIX_SQL_EVIDENCE.md so you can point to receipts instantly.
