# FAQ & Objections

Q: Why say 10–15 lakhs if we paid 70K?
- Because that’s what comparable multi‑vendor + booking + payouts + encryption platforms cost in Nepal. We delivered it efficiently and ethically — that’s the over‑delivery.

Q: Is this ready for beta?
- Yes. Security controls, booking integrity, trust engine, and admin safety are in place. Monitoring will make beta even smoother.

Q: What about a mobile app?
- Realistic Nepal pricing: 1.5–2.0 lakhs for a solid cross‑platform MVP. We’ll scope after beta usage confirms priorities.

Q: Ongoing costs?
- Sentry events, uptime monitors, backups, and DR tests have operational costs. Retainer options keep spend predictable.
