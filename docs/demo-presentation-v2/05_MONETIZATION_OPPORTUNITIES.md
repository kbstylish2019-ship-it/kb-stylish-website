# Monetization Opportunities Built‑In

- Featured Brands on Homepage
  - Only brands with active products
  - Sell monthly “featured” slots (tiered pricing)

- Featured Stylists
  - Promote top stylists on landing pages
  - Encourage profile upgrades (photos, reviews) → higher bookings

- Sponsored Placements
  - “Trending” has guardrails, but you can sell “Promoted” tiles alongside

- Commission & Fees
  - Per‑vendor commission adjustable with audit trail
  - Payouts are transparent; arithmetic check prevents leakage

- Vendor Services
  - Photo enhancements, store setup, priority support → chargeable add‑ons

- Data Products
  - Vendor dashboards + PDF statements; future premium analytics add‑on

Tie each to real UI spots during the demo so the client sees new revenue streams, not just features.
