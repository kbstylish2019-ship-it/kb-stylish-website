## üìã THE 10-PHASE EXCELLENCE PROTOCOL

### PHASE 1: CODEBASE IMMERSION (Mandatory - 30-60 min)

**Goal**: Build complete mental model of KB Stylish architecture

#### 1.1 Read Architecture Documents
```
REQUIRED READING (in order):
1. docs/GOVERNANCE_ENGINE_PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md
2. docs/ARCHITECTURE OF GOVERNANCE ENGINE.MD
3. docs/README.md or docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (if exists)
4. docs/*_FORENSIC_AUDIT.md (if related to task)
5. Any task-specific documentation
```

#### 1.2 Understand Core Systems
```
MAP THESE SYSTEMS:
- Authentication: JWT flow, role-based access (admin/vendor/customer)
- Database: Supabase/PostgreSQL schema, RLS policies
- Edge Functions: Which exist, their purpose, version history
- Frontend: Next.js structure, server vs client components
- State Management: Zustand stores, localStorage patterns
- API Layer: apiClient.ts patterns, caching strategies
```

#### 1.3 Identify Existing Patterns
```
DOCUMENT:
- Naming conventions (files, functions, variables)
- Error handling patterns
- Security patterns (SECURITY INVOKER/DEFINER, RLS)
- Testing patterns (E2E, unit, integration)
- Database migration patterns
- Edge Function deployment patterns
```

#### 1.4 Check for Related Code
```sql
-- Search codebase for similar implementations
grep -r "similar_feature_name" src/
grep -r "related_function" supabase/
```

**OUTPUT**: Architecture map document showing data flow, dependencies, patterns

## üìö KB STYLISH SPECIFIC CONTEXT

### Project Architecture
```
KB STYLISH - Multi-vendor E-commerce + Booking Platform
Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Components)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- Auth: JWT with role-based access (admin/vendor/customer)
- State: Zustand stores
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Testing: Playwright E2E
```

### Key Systems
```
1. AUTHENTICATION
   - JWT tokens with user_metadata.user_roles
   - RLS policies on all tables
   - public.user_has_role() helper function

2. GOVERNANCE ENGINE
   - metrics schema (vendor_daily, platform_daily)
   - Real-time dashboard for admin/vendor
   - Event-driven metrics updates

3. COMMERCE ENGINE
   - Cart system (guest + authenticated)
   - Order processing pipeline
   - Inventory management with OCC

4. TRUST ENGINE
   - Review system with purchase verification
   - Sharded vote counters
   - Vendor reply system

5. EDGE FUNCTIONS
   - Dual-client pattern (userClient + serviceClient)
   - Auth in global headers
   - CORS with specific origins
```

### Existing Patterns
```
DATABASE FUNCTIONS:
- public.* = SECURITY INVOKER (inherits user's RLS)
- private.* = SECURITY DEFINER (bypasses RLS for admin)
- Always SET search_path = 'schema1, schema2, pg_temp'
- Self-defending: Check auth.uid() and roles

EDGE FUNCTIONS:
- createDualClients(authHeader) for user + service clients
- verifyUser() for JWT extraction
- errorResponse() for consistent errors
- getCorsHeaders() for CORS

FRONTEND:
- Async Server Components for data fetching
- Client components for interactivity
- fetchWithAuth() for API calls
- Error boundaries for graceful failures
```

### Migration Pattern
```sql
-- ALWAYS use timestamped migrations
-- Format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql

-- Example:
-- 20251012120000_add_metrics_reconciliation.sql

BEGIN;
  -- Make changes here
  -- Include rollback plan as comments
COMMIT;
```

## üéì INVESTIGATION PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Assume Nothing**
- Even if code looks correct, verify it works
- Even if documentation says something, test it
- Even if tests pass, manually verify behavior

### 2. **Follow the Data**
- Trace data through EVERY layer
- Verify persistence at each step
- Check for gaps in the flow

### 3. **Think Like an Attacker**
- How would you exploit this?
- What's the worst-case scenario?
- What if inputs are malicious?

### 4. **Think Like a User**
- What's the UX for errors?
- Is it intuitive?
- Does it work on slow connections?

### 5. **Think Like a Database**
- What's the query plan?
- Are there locks?
- What happens under concurrent load?

---

## üìû WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP

**ASK THE USER IF**:
1. Requirements unclear or ambiguous
2. Multiple valid approaches exist
3. Breaking changes required
4. Major architectural decision needed
5. Business logic assumptions needed
6. Performance tradeoffs unclear

**DON'T ASK THE USER IF**:
1. Syntax errors (fix yourself)
2. Best practices (follow them)
3. Code style (match existing)
4. Bug fixes (fix and explain)
5. Test writing (write them)
