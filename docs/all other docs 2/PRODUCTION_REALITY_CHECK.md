**Protocol**: Universal AI Excellence Protocol - Full Stack Trace

## 🎯 INVESTIGATION SCOPE

User reported critical concerns about production features:

1. ❓ **Commission Rate** - Does it actually work?
2. ❓ **User Role Assignment** - Does it persist correctly?
3. ❌ **User Pagination** - Missing implementation
4. ❌ **Category Management** - Admin CRUD not implemented

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS...

### Finding 1: Commission Rate Reality Check

**User Question**: *"Does changing commission_rate actually affect platform fees in dashboard?"*

**Evidence Collected**:

✅ **Function Exists**: `update_vendor_commission()` 
- Admin can update via UI (confirmed in screenshot)
- Function validates 0-100% range
- Logs changes in `user_audit_log`

🔍 **Current Commission Rates** (VERIFIED):
```sql
Vendor Demo        → 12% (changed from default!)
Test Vendor        → 14% (changed from default!)
Fake Company       → 15% (default)
Default Vendor     → 15% (default)
Other Vendor       → 10% (changed from default!)
```

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Some vendors already have custom rates!

Now checking: **Do calculations actually use these rates?**
