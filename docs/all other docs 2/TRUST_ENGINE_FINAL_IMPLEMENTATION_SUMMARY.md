## 🔬 LIVE BACKEND VERIFICATION RESULTS

### Test 1: Job Queue Status
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM job_queue 
WHERE job_type = 'update_product_rating' 
GROUP BY status;
```
**Result**: 
- ✅ 32 jobs in PENDING status (reset from failed)
- ✅ Ready for ratings-worker to process

### Test 2: RPC Function Validation
```sql
SELECT update_product_rating_stats('<product-id>');
```
**Result**:
- ✅ Function works perfectly
- ✅ Returns: `{"success": true, "average_rating": 4, "review_count": 2}`

### Test 3: Database Schema
**Result**:
- ✅ All tables exist and correct
- ✅ review_votes table properly structured
- ✅ job_queue columns verified

### Test 4: Products Needing Updates
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products 
WHERE review_count > 0 AND average_rating = 0;
```
**Result**: 0 (one product already has rating, others pending worker)
