**Date**: October 24, 2025

---

## 🎯 PANEL OBJECTIVE

Review the proposed stylist rating system design and provide expert recommendations on:
1. Database schema design
2. Security and RLS policies
3. Performance optimization
4. UX/UI best practices
5. System integration and edge cases

---

## 👨‍💼 EXPERT 1: SENIOR DATABASE ARCHITECT

### Questions Answered:

#### Q1: Is the proposed schema sound?
**Answer**: 🟢 **YES** - Well-designed with minor recommendations

**Schema Review**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE stylist_ratings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id UUID UNIQUE,        ← ✅ Good: Prevents duplicates
  customer_user_id UUID,
  stylist_user_id UUID,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (1-5),     ← ✅ Good: Constrained
  review_text TEXT,
  is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,  ← ⚠️ Question: Auto-approve?
  ...
);
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ One-to-one with bookings (UNIQUE constraint)
- ✅ Proper foreign keys with CASCADE
- ✅ Rating bounds enforced
- ✅ Indexes on query-heavy columns

**Recommendations**:

**1. Add Review Length Constraint**:
```sql
review_text TEXT CHECK (LENGTH(review_text) <= 1000),
```
**Why**: Prevent abuse, ensure reasonable review lengths

**2. Add Response Field** (Future-proofing):
```sql
stylist_response TEXT,
responded_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
responded_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
```
**Why**: Allow stylists to reply (like product reviews)

**3. Add Quality Score** (Optional):
```sql
quality_score NUMERIC(3,2)  -- AI-generated 0-1 score
```
**Why**: Detect low-quality/spam reviews automatically

---

#### Q2: How should we handle the trigger for rating_average?
**Answer**: **Current approach is good** but add safeguards

**Improved Trigger**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_stylist_rating_average()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  v_avg NUMERIC(3,2);
  v_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
  -- Only process if rating is approved
  IF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' AND OLD.is_approved = NEW.is_approved THEN
    RETURN NEW;  -- Skip if approval status unchanged
  END IF;
  
  -- Calculate with subquery for safety
  SELECT 
    AVG(rating)::NUMERIC(3,2),
    COUNT(*)
  INTO v_avg, v_count
  FROM stylist_ratings
  WHERE stylist_user_id = COALESCE(NEW.stylist_user_id, OLD.stylist_user_id)
    AND is_approved = true;
  
  -- Update stylist profile
  UPDATE stylist_profiles
  SET 
    rating_average = v_avg,
    -- Also update review count!
    metadata = jsonb_set(
      COALESCE(metadata, '{}'::jsonb),
      '{review_count}',
      v_count::text::jsonb
    ),
    updated_at = NOW()
  WHERE user_id = COALESCE(NEW.stylist_user_id, OLD.stylist_user_id);
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Why Better**:
- Handles both INSERT and UPDATE
- Skips unnecessary recalculations
- Updates review count in metadata
- Uses COALESCE for DELETE operations

---

#### Q3: What about data integrity with deleted bookings?
**Answer**: ⚠️ **Need to consider cascade behavior**

**Current Design**:
```sql
booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

**Issue**: If booking deleted → rating deleted (maybe unwanted?)

**Better Approach**:
```sql
booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```

**Reasoning**:
- Keep rating history even if booking deleted
- Add `deleted_booking_metadata JSONB` to store booking info
- Maintain rating_average integrity

**OR Keep CASCADE if**:
- Bookings should never be deleted (soft delete instead)
- Use `deleted_at` column on bookings table

**Verdict**: Keep CASCADE but add soft delete to bookings

---

## ⚡ EXPERT 2: PERFORMANCE ENGINEER

### Questions Answered:

#### Q1: What's the performance impact of the trigger?
**Answer**: 🟡 **MODERATE** - Can be optimized

**Analysis**:
```
Each rating INSERT/UPDATE triggers:
1. SELECT AVG() over all approved ratings (Could be 1000s)
2. UPDATE on stylist_profiles

Worst case: O(n) where n = total ratings for stylist
```

**Performance Test Scenario**:
```
Stylist with 500 ratings
New rating added
→ AVG() scans 500 rows
→ ~5-10ms query time

Acceptable? YES for <1000 ratings per stylist
```

**Optimization**: Materialized aggregate (if needed later)
```sql
-- If performance becomes issue:
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW stylist_rating_stats AS
SELECT 
  stylist_user_id,
  AVG(rating) as avg_rating,
  COUNT(*) as review_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN rating = 5 THEN 1 END) as five_star_count
FROM stylist_ratings
WHERE is_approved = true
GROUP BY stylist_user_id;

-- Refresh on schedule or trigger
CREATE INDEX ON stylist_rating_stats(stylist_user_id);
```

---

#### Q2: How do indexes impact write performance?
**Answer**: 🟢 **MINIMAL** - Indexes are necessary

**Proposed Indexes**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_stylist_ratings_stylist 
  ON stylist_ratings(stylist_user_id) 
  WHERE is_approved = true;  -- ✅ Partial index (smaller)

CREATE INDEX idx_stylist_ratings_customer 
  ON stylist_ratings(customer_user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_stylist_ratings_booking 
  ON stylist_ratings(booking_id);
```

**Write Impact**:
- Each INSERT updates 3 indexes
- Adds ~2-3ms per insert
- **Acceptable** for user-initiated actions

**Query Benefits**:
- Fetch ratings for stylist: Uses idx_stylist_ratings_stylist
- Check if customer rated: Uses idx_stylist_ratings_customer
- Verify booking rated: Uses idx_stylist_ratings_booking

**Verdict**: ✅ All indexes justified

---

#### Q3: Should we paginate ratings display?
**Answer**: ✅ **YES** - Always paginate

**Recommendation**:
```typescript
// API: GET /api/stylists/:id/ratings
?page=1&limit=10&sort=recent

// Frontend: Infinite scroll or traditional pagination
```

**Why**:
- Top stylists could have 100s of ratings
- Loading all at once = slow
- Better UX with pagination

---

## 🔒 EXPERT 3: SECURITY ARCHITECT

### Questions Answered:

#### Q1: Are the RLS policies secure?
**Answer**: 🟡 **MOSTLY** - With recommended additions

**Policy Review**:

**✅ GOOD - SELECT Policy**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view approved ratings"
ON stylist_ratings FOR SELECT
USING (is_approved = true);
```
**Security**: ✅ Only approved ratings public

---

**⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - INSERT Policy**:
```sql
-- CURRENT (from Phase 1):
CREATE POLICY "Users can rate their own completed bookings"
ON stylist_ratings FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() = customer_user_id
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM bookings
    WHERE bookings.id = booking_id
      AND bookings.customer_user_id = auth.uid()
      AND bookings.status = 'completed'
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM stylist_ratings
    WHERE stylist_ratings.booking_id = booking_id
  )
);
```

**Issue**: Expensive nested queries on every INSERT

**IMPROVED**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION can_rate_booking(p_booking_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM bookings
    WHERE id = p_booking_id
      AND customer_user_id = auth.uid()
      AND status = 'completed'
      AND id NOT IN (
        SELECT booking_id 
        FROM stylist_ratings 
        WHERE booking_id = p_booking_id
      )
  );
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE POLICY "Users can rate their own completed bookings"
ON stylist_ratings FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() = customer_user_id
  AND can_rate_booking(booking_id)
);
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier to test
- Can be called from API
- Cleaner RLS policy

---

#### Q2: Can users manipulate ratings?
**Answer**: **Current design prevents most attacks** ✅

**Attack Vectors Considered**:

**1. Spam Multiple Ratings**:
```
Attack: Submit many ratings for same booking
Defense: ✅ UNIQUE(booking_id) constraint
Result: BLOCKED
```

**2. Rate Without Booking**:
```
Attack: Create rating with fake booking_id
Defense: ✅ Foreign key + RLS checks booking ownership
Result: BLOCKED
```

**3. Edit Rating to Spam**:
```
Attack: Submit good review, edit to spam
Defense: ⚠️ UPDATE policy allows edits
Recommendation: Add time window or flag edited reviews
```

**Improved UPDATE Policy**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update ratings within 7 days"
ON stylist_ratings FOR UPDATE
USING (
  auth.uid() = customer_user_id
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() = customer_user_id
  AND rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5  -- Re-validate bounds
);
```

**4. Delete Others' Ratings**:
```
Attack: Delete competitor's good ratings
Defense: ✅ DELETE policy admin-only
Result: BLOCKED
```

---

#### Q3: Should we implement rate limiting?
**Answer**: ✅ **YES** - Prevent abuse

**Recommendation**:
```typescript
// API Route: /api/stylists/rate
import { rateLimit } from '@/lib/rateLimit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  interval: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  uniqueTokenPerInterval: 500,
});

// Allow 5 ratings per minute per user
await limiter.check(userId, 5);
```

**Why**: Prevent automated rating spam

## 🎨 EXPERT 4: UX/UI DESIGNER

### Questions Answered:

#### Q1: Where should the rating flow appear?
**Answer**: **Multiple touchpoints for accessibility**

**Primary Location**: My Bookings Page
```
Booking Card:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Haircut with Sarah Johnson          │
│ Oct 24, 2025 • 10:00 AM            │
│ Status: Completed ✅                │
│                                      │
│ [⭐ Rate Your Experience]           │ ← Primary CTA
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Secondary Locations**:
1. **Email notification** (24 hours after service)
   - "How was your appointment?"
   - Click → Opens website with rating modal

2. **Homepage banner** (if unrated completed bookings exist)
   - "You have 2 appointments to rate!"

---

#### Q2: What should the rating modal look like?
**Answer**: **Simple, focused, mobile-first**

**Modal Design**:
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Rate Your Experience        │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                        │
│  Haircut with Sarah Johnson           │
│  Oct 24, 2025                          │
│                                        │
│  How would you rate your service?     │
│                                        │
│    ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆  (Interactive stars)    │
│                                        │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Tell us more (optional)          │ │
│  │                                  │ │
│  │                                  │ │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  0/500 characters                     │
│                                        │
│  [Cancel]              [Submit] │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key UX Principles**:
- Stars are primary action (must be clicked first)
- Review text optional (reduces friction)
- Character count visible
- Submit button disabled until star selected
- Mobile-friendly (large tap targets)

---

#### Q3: Should we show rating breakdown?
**Answer**: ✅ **YES** - Builds trust

**On Stylist Card** (Detailed View):
```
⭐ 4.8 (127 reviews)

5 ★ ███████████████████░░ 85
4 ★ ███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 30
3 ★ ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  8
2 ★ █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  3
1 ★ ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1
```

**Why**: Helps customers make informed decisions

## 🔧 EXPERT 5: PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS ENGINEER

### Questions Answered:

#### Q1: How do we handle the 'completed' booking status?
**Answer**: **Auto-complete with manual override**

**Recommended Flow**:
```
1. Booking created → status: 'confirmed'
2. Appointment time passes
3. Auto-complete job runs:
   - Check: end_time + 60 minutes < NOW()
   - Update: status = 'completed'
4. Stylist can manually mark complete earlier
5. Customer notification: "Rate your experience"
```

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Cron job or edge function (runs hourly)
UPDATE bookings
SET 
  status = 'completed',
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'confirmed'
  AND end_time < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND end_time < NOW();  -- Safety: Don't complete future bookings
```

**Manual Override** (for stylists):
```typescript
// API: PATCH /api/bookings/:id/complete
// Only stylist who owns the booking can mark complete
```

---

#### Q2: What happens if rating fails mid-transaction?
**Answer**: **Use database transactions** ✅

**API Implementation**:
```typescript
async function submitRating(bookingId, rating, reviewText) {
  const supabase = createClient();
  
  // Start transaction
  const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('submit_rating_atomic', {
    p_booking_id: bookingId,
    p_rating: rating,
    p_review_text: reviewText
  });
  
  if (error) {
    // Transaction rolled back automatically
    throw new Error('Rating submission failed');
  }
  
  return data;
}
```

**RPC Function**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION submit_rating_atomic(
  p_booking_id UUID,
  p_rating INTEGER,
  p_review_text TEXT DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS jsonb AS $$
DECLARE
  v_rating_id UUID;
  v_stylist_id UUID;
BEGIN
  -- Validation (will fail if checks don't pass)
  SELECT stylist_user_id INTO v_stylist_id
  FROM bookings
  WHERE id = p_booking_id
    AND customer_user_id = auth.uid()
    AND status = 'completed';
  
  IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Booking not found or not completed';
  END IF;
  
  -- Check if already rated
  IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM stylist_ratings WHERE booking_id = p_booking_id) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Booking already rated';
  END IF;
  
  -- Insert rating (trigger will update rating_average)
  INSERT INTO stylist_ratings (
    booking_id,
    customer_user_id,
    stylist_user_id,
    rating,
    review_text,
    is_approved
  ) VALUES (
    p_booking_id,
    auth.uid(),
    v_stylist_id,
    p_rating,
    p_review_text,
    true  -- Auto-approve
  )
  RETURNING id INTO v_rating_id;
  
  -- Return success
  RETURN jsonb_build_object(
    'success', true,
    'rating_id', v_rating_id
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

---

#### Q3: What are the edge cases?
**Answer**: **Comprehensive list with mitigations**

**Edge Cases**:

**1. Booking cancelled after completion**:
```
Scenario: Booking completed → Customer rates → Booking cancelled later
Issue: Rating still exists for cancelled booking
Mitigation: Don't allow cancellation of completed bookings
```

**2. Stylist account deleted**:
```
Scenario: Stylist deletes account → Ratings still exist
Mitigation: Soft delete stylist_profiles (set is_active = false)
            Keep ratings but hide stylist from search
```

**3. Customer deletes account**:
```
Scenario: Customer deletes account → Rating becomes anonymous
Mitigation: ON DELETE CASCADE on customer_user_id
            OR keep rating but show as "Former Customer"
```

**4. Duplicate tab submission**:
```
Scenario: User opens two tabs → Submits rating twice
Mitigation: UNIQUE(booking_id) constraint catches duplicate
            Show user-friendly error: "Already rated"
```

**5. Rating right at 7-day edit deadline**:
```
Scenario: Edit window expires mid-edit
Mitigation: Check deadline server-side, show warning in UI
```
