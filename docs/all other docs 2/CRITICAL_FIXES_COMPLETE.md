## ✅ FIX #1: PAYMENT STUCK - CUSTOMER RESCUED (P0 CRITICAL)

### Problem:
Customer (Aakriti Bhandari) paid NPR 2,399 for 2 stylist bookings but:
- Payment succeeded ✅
- **NO order created** ❌
- **NO bookings created** ❌
- User stuck at "Finalizing Order" screen

### Root Cause:
Database constraint `bookings_payment_intent_unique UNIQUE (payment_intent_id)` prevented creating multiple bookings with same payment ID.

**This was WRONG**: A single payment CAN contain multiple bookings!

### Solution Implemented:

**1. Dropped Incorrect Constraint**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.bookings
DROP CONSTRAINT bookings_payment_intent_unique;
```

**2. Manually Created Missing Data**:
```sql
-- Created 2 bookings:
-- Booking 1: Hair Color (NPR 800) on Oct 27, 2025
-- Booking 2: Service 2 (NPR 1,500) on Oct 27, 2025

-- Created 1 order:
-- Order Total: NPR 2,399
-- Status: confirmed
-- Payment Intent: pi_esewa_1761301554033_c7d366e9
```

**Migration**: `fix_booking_payment_intent_constraint`

### Impact:
- ✅ Customer's payment now shows valid order and bookings
- ✅ Future multi-booking payments will work correctly
- ✅ No more stuck payments

### Files Changed:
- **Database**: 1 constraint dropped, manual data insert

---

## ✅ FIX #2 & #3: RATING UI IMPROVEMENTS (P1 HIGH)

### Problems:
1. Users could click "Rate" on already-rated bookings → confusing error
2. After rating, button still showed "Rate" → no visual feedback

### Solution Implemented:

**1. Backend - Include Rating Status**:

**File**: `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`

Added rating data to bookings query:
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  service:services(...),
  stylist:stylist_profiles(...),
  rating:stylist_ratings (
    rating,
    review_text,
    created_at
  )
`)
```

**2. Frontend - Conditional Button Display**:

**File**: `src/components/customer/MyBookingsClient.tsx`

```typescript
{booking.status === 'completed' && (
  <>
    {booking.rating ? (
      // Show "Rated ★★★" (disabled)
      <Button disabled className="bg-green-500/20 text-green-300">
        <Star className="fill-yellow-400" />
        Rated {booking.rating.rating}★
      </Button>
    ) : (
      // Show "Rate" button (clickable)
      <Button onClick={() => openRatingModal()}>
        <Star />
        Rate
      </Button>
    )}
  </>
)}
```

### UX Flow:

**Before Rating**:
```
[Completed Booking]
[Details] [⭐ Rate] [Rebook]
```

**After Rating**:
```
[Completed Booking]
[Details] [Rated ★★★★☆] [Rebook]  ← Green, disabled
```

### Impact:
- ✅ Users see instant feedback after rating
- ✅ Can't accidentally rate twice
- ✅ Clear visual indicator of rated bookings

### Files Changed:
- `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts` (backend query)
- `src/components/customer/MyBookingsClient.tsx` (interface + UI logic)

---
