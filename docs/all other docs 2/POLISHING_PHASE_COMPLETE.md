```
BEFORE:                    AFTER:
M / Black                  [M] [●Black]
No image                   [Product Image]
Plain text                 Styled badges + swatches
```

### **2. React Key Warning** 🐛 **MINOR**
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Files Changed**: 1

**What Was Fixed**:
- Added explicit keys to variant badge spans in ProductList
- Eliminates "Each child in list should have unique key" warning

---

### **3. Login Modal State Bug** 🐛 **MEDIUM**
**Time**: 3 minutes  
**Files Changed**: 1

**What Was Fixed**:
- Modal now resets form state when closed/reopened
- No more stuck "Signing in..." spinner
- Clean state on every modal open

**Implementation**:
- Added key prop to LoginForm and RegisterForm components

### **4. Admin Sidebar Link** 🐛 **MINOR**
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Files Changed**: 1

**What Was Fixed**:

### **5. Vendor Application Logic** 🐛 **MEDIUM**
**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Files Changed**: 1

**What Was Fixed**:
- Properly handles all application states:
  - `draft` → Shows form with "Continue Application" notice
  - `submitted` / `under_review` → Shows "Under Review" status
  - `info_requested` → Shows "Additional Info Needed"
  - `approved` → Redirects to vendor dashboard ✅
  - `rejected` → Shows rejection notice + allows reapplication
  - `null` (new) → Shows application form

**Before**: Draft applications showed nothing (blank page)  
**After**: All states have appropriate UI

---

## ⏳ REMAINING ITEMS (Lower Priority)

From original polishing phase list:

### **Medium Priority** (Can wait)
1. ⏳ **Cart Persistence Bug** - Needs user testing data
   - Issue: Products disappear when service added
   - Status: Debug guide created, waiting for test results
   
2. ⏳ **Avatar Display Consistency** - Apply gradient style everywhere
   - Already works with current upload integration
   
3. ⏳ **Google OAuth Integration** - Add Google sign-in
   - Requires OAuth app setup
   
4. ⏳ **Redirect After Login** - Better post-login flow
   - Current flow works, just not optimized

### **Low Priority** (Polish)
1. ⏳ **Admin Sidebar Grouping** - Add dropdown sections
   - Current sidebar works, just flat list
