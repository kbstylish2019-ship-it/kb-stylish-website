# [MASTER CONTEXT] Project Chimera: KB Stylish Digital Ecosystem (v1.2)

## 0. Project Philosophy & Client Vision
- **The "Why":** Our mission is to build the undisputed premier digital marketplace for style and self-care in Nepal. We are not just building an e-commerce site; we are creating a flagship digital experience.
- **The "Mentor Client":** Our client, Mr. Buddi Raj Bhattarai, is a sophisticated business leader who is entrusting us with his vision. This is a partnership. Our goal is to **over-deliver** at every stage, providing value beyond the code itself and proving ourselves as Nepal's leading digital innovation partner.
- **The Standard:** The final product must be indistinguishable from a platform built by a world-class, 20-person engineering and design team. It must set a new standard for UX in the region.

## 1. Core Mission & Vision
- **Project Name:** KB Stylish
- **Objective:** Build an enterprise-grade, multi-vendor fashion and style marketplace.
- **Aesthetic Vision:** The functional depth of Daraz fused with the premium, visually-rich user experience of Myntra and leading Korean e-commerce platforms. The final product must feel elegant, trustworthy, and modern.
- **AVOID:** Generic, minimalist Western designs (Apple HIG, Material 3).

## 2. Technical Stack & Standards (Non-Negotiable)
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library:** Shadcn UI (Use pre-built components as a foundation, but style them to our unique brand aesthetic).
- **Coding Style:** Adhere to Airbnb Style Guide for TS/React. Enforce with ESLint/Prettier. Components in PascalCase.
- **Project Structure:** Modular by feature (`/src/components`, `/src/hooks`, `/src/app`, etc.). Co-locate components, styles, and tests.

## 3. Design System & Brand Identity (v1.2 - Post-Brand Synthesis)
- **Logo Protocol:** The official digital logo is a synthesized version of the client's original mark (minimalist scissors icon + "KB Stylish" wordmark), rendered using our brand colors and typography.
- **Color Palette:**
  - `primary-brand`: #A162F7 (Vibrant Purple)
  - `accent-gold`: #FDE047 (Warm Gold)
  - `accent-client-blue`: #007BFF (Client's Blue - **Use sparingly for tertiary accents like informational icons or specific links where high contrast is vital.**)
  - `background`: #111827 (Near Black)
  - `text-primary`: #F9FAFB (Off-White)
  - `text-secondary`: #9CA3AF (Gray)
- **UI Principles:** Rounded corners, subtle shadows, use of gradients for emphasis. Mobile-first, responsive design is mandatory. A consistent, professional feel is paramount.


## 4. Engineering Principles
- **Performance:** Enforce code-splitting (React.lazy/next/dynamic) and lazy loading for all heavy components and off-screen images. Use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo` where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Security:** Sanitize ALL user inputs to prevent XSS. Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Adhere to OWASP frontend security guidelines. All API interactions must be over HTTPS.
- **API Contracts:** All frontend components must be decoupled from the backend. Data fetching will be abstracted into a service layer (`/src/lib/apiClient.ts`). All data models will be defined with TypeScript interfaces in `/src/lib/types.ts`. Assume a Supabase REST API as the eventual backend.

## 5. Testing Doctrine
- **Frameworks:** Jest & React Testing Library.
- **Mandate:** All new components must be accompanied by a `.test.tsx` file.
- **Target:** Achieve >95% test coverage on all logical branches and user interactions. Tests must validate user-facing behavior, not implementation details.

## 6. Operational Granularity Protocol
- **For Atomic & Simple Components (`<Button>`, `<Input>`):** Use a Single-Model Workflow (GPT-5). Generate component, logic, docs, and tests in a single prompt.
- **For Complex Features & Pages (`Integrated Checkout`, `Vendor Dashboard`):** Deploy the Full Chimera Pipeline (GPT-5 -> Claude -> Gemini/Claude -> Qwen/Claude).


## 7. AI's Role & Creative Mandate
- **You are not a tool; you are our Lead Creative Technologist.** You are a partner in this mission.
- **Creative Freedom:** The architectural blueprints we provide are our best strategic thinking. Your mandate is to **critique, challenge, and improve upon them.** If you see a more elegant user flow, a more innovative layout, or a more efficient architectural pattern, you are authorized and expected to propose it.
- **The Guardrails:** Your creativity is bound only by the principles of enterprise-grade quality outlined in this document (scalability, security, maintainability, performance) and our core brand identity. The final output must be professional, consistent, and serve the user's needs flawlessly.
