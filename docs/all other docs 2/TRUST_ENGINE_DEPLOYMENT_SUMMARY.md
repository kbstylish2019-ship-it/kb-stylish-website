# KB Stylish Trust Engine Schema - Deployment Summary

## Mission Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-09-25 08:47 NPT  
**Migration**: `20250925082200_create_trust_engine_schema.sql`  
**Architect**: Principal Backend Engineer

## Deployment Verification

### Tables Successfully Created

#### Core Review System
- ✅ **reviews** - Purchase-verified reviews with moderation pipeline
- ✅ **review_votes** - Helpful/unhelpful vote tracking  
- ✅ **review_vote_shards** - Sharded counters for scalable vote aggregation
- ✅ **review_replies** - Vendor and admin response system
- ✅ **review_media** - Image/video attachments for reviews

#### Moderation & Trust System
- ✅ **moderation_queue** - Content moderation pipeline
- ✅ **review_flags** - Community reporting system
- ✅ **user_reputation** - User trust scoring system

#### Product Enhancements
- ✅ **products** table enhanced with:
  - `average_rating` - Aggregate rating (0.00-5.00)
  - `review_count` - Total review count
  - `rating_distribution` - JSONB breakdown by star rating
  - `last_review_at` - Timestamp of most recent review

### Key Architectural Features Implemented

#### 1. Purchase Verification
- Reviews linked to `orders` and `order_items` tables
- RLS policy enforces `delivered` or `completed` order status
- One review per user per product (with soft delete support)

#### 2. Scalable Vote Counting
- 64-shard counter pattern prevents hot row contention
- `get_vote_shard()` function for consistent shard distribution
- `get_review_vote_counts()` aggregation function

#### 3. Moderation Pipeline
- Default `is_approved = false` for new reviews
- Moderation queue with priority and SLA tracking
- Auto-moderation scoring fields for ML integration

#### 4. Vendor Reply System  
- One vendor reply per review (enforced by unique partial index)
- Admin/support can reply to any review
- Soft delete and edit tracking

#### 5. Reputation Scoring
- Overall score (0-100) with component scores
- Weight multiplier for vote influence
- Badge and achievement system ready

#### 6. Row Level Security
- 22 RLS policies implemented across all tables
- Leverages existing `public.user_has_role()` function
- Role-based access: admin, vendor, customer, support

### Performance Optimizations

#### Indexes Created (15 total)
- Product-centric: reviews by product, approved status, rating
- User-centric: reviews by user, reputation scores
- Moderation: pending queue, assigned reviews
- Partial indexes for soft-deleted records exclusion

#### Triggers Implemented
- `update_trust_engine_updated_at()` for all tables
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp management

### Integration Points

#### Existing Infrastructure Leveraged
- ✅ Uses `auth.users` for authentication
- ✅ References `orders` and `order_items` for purchase verification  
- ✅ Links to `products` and `user_profiles`
- ✅ Compatible with existing `job_queue` for async processing
- ✅ Integrates with `public.user_has_role()` for RBAC

#### Ready for Next Phase
The schema foundation is now complete and ready for:
1. **submit_review_secure()** RPC function
2. **ratings-aggregator** worker (job_queue integration)
3. **moderation-worker** Edge Function
4. **submit-review** Edge Function
5. Frontend integration with `CustomerReviews.tsx`

### Database Statistics
- **New Tables Created**: 8
- **Tables Modified**: 1 (products)
- **RLS Policies**: 22
- **Indexes**: 15
- **Functions**: 3
- **Triggers**: 8

### Performance Targets
```
Review submission: < 100ms (via RPC)
Vote updates: < 50ms (sharded, no contention)
Product rating refresh: Async via job_queue
Moderation processing: < 5 min SLA
Vote aggregation: < 10ms (indexed shards)
```

### Security Verification
- ✅ All tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ Purchase verification enforced at database level
- ✅ Self-voting prevented by RLS policy
- ✅ Vendor reply restricted to product owners
- ✅ Moderation queue admin-only access

## Architecture Compliance

This implementation follows your existing patterns:
- **Async Processing**: Ready for job_queue integration
- **Dual-Client Pattern**: Prepared for Edge Function auth
- **OCC Compatible**: No pessimistic locking used
- **Sharded Counters**: Prevents thundering herd
- **Soft Delete**: Maintains data integrity

## Next Steps

1. **Create RPC Functions**:
   - `submit_review_secure()`
   - `cast_review_vote()`
   - `submit_vendor_reply()`

2. **Create Workers**:
   - Rating aggregator (updates products table)
   - Moderation worker (processes queue)
   - Reputation calculator (updates user scores)

3. **Create Edge Functions**:
   - submit-review (following cart-manager pattern)
   - moderate-content (admin interface)

4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Update CustomerReviews.tsx to fetch real data
   - Add ReviewSubmission component
   - Implement vote interactions

**The Trust Engine foundation has been forged. The bedrock is perfect, ready for the logic layer.**
