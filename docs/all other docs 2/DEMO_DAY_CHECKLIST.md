```
"Mr. Bhattarai, good to see you!"

[Pause, smile]

"Before we start, I want to share something important. 
I researched market rates for platforms like this..."

[Share screen OR show notes]

"Basic multi-vendor platforms in Nepal: 500K to 2 million rupees.
Enterprise platforms globally: $50K to $300K USD.

What you're about to see is worth NPR 3 to 4 million 
in market value."

[Pause - let that sink in]

"We delivered it for 70K because we believe in KB Stylish.

Let me show you why this is special."

[Start demo]
```

**Practice this 3 times before meeting. Timing: 90 seconds exactly.**

- **Pause for effect** (after key points)
- **Show enthusiasm** (genuine excitement)
- **Sound confident** (you earned this)

### Don'ts ‚ùå

- Don't downplay achievements

- Don't rush through demos

---

## üö® EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### If Internet Drops
```
Immediate Response:
1. "Give me one moment..."
2. Switch to mobile hotspot (30 seconds)
3. "Technical hiccup - switching connections"
4. Resume from last point

If persists:
"The platform is solid - this is my internet. 
Let me show you screenshots I prepared, 
and we can reschedule for live demo if needed."
```

### If Site Has Bug
```
Minor Issue:
"I'll note that for immediate fix. 
The core system is production-ready - 
this is minor polish."

Major Issue:
"This worked perfectly yesterday. 
Let me show you the alternative flow..."
[Use different feature/journey]
```

### If They Challenge Value Claims
```
"That's a great question. I have market research 
from three independent sources - HTMLPanda, 
CS-Cart, and Nepal-based agencies.

Would you like to see the detailed breakdown?"

[Have VALUE_METRICS ready to share]
```

### If They Ask About Those "Admin Issues"
```
"Great awareness! Those are non-critical 
database optimizations - about an hour of work.

They don't affect customer, vendor, or stylist 
journeys at all. Everything production-facing 
is flawless.

I'm fixing those this week as post-launch polish."
