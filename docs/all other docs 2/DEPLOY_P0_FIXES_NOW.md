## ⏰ STEP 2: SETUP CRON JOB (3 minutes)

Choose ONE method:

### Method A: Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau
2. Navigate to **Edge Functions**
3. Click on `ratings-worker`
4. Click **"Add trigger"** → **"Cron"**
5. Set schedule: `*/2 * * * *` (every 2 minutes)
6. Click **Save**

### Method B: pg_cron Extension
```sql
-- Run this in SQL Editor
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'ratings-worker-trigger',
  '*/2 * * * *',
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url:='https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/ratings-worker',
    headers:=jsonb_build_object(
      'Authorization', 
      'Bearer ' || current_setting('app.settings.service_role_key', true)
    )
  );
  $$
);
```

## 🌐 STEP 3: DEPLOY NEXT.JS APP (5 minutes)

### 3A: Build Production Bundle
```bash
cd d:\kb-stylish
npm run build
```

### 3B: Deploy to Vercel/Production
```bash
# If using Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or push to main branch (auto-deploy)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement P0 Trust Engine fixes - security & ratings worker"
git push origin main
```

**New API Routes Deployed:**
- ✅ `/api/user/reviews/eligibility` - Review eligibility check
- ✅ `/api/auth/csrf` - CSRF token generation
- ✅ `/api/user/reviews/submit` - Review submission with rate limiting
- ✅ `/api/trust/vote` - Vote casting with CSRF protection

---

## 🧪 STEP 4: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT (5 minutes)

### 4A: Test Ratings Worker
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This will manually trigger the worker to process pending jobs
SELECT net.http_post(
  url:='https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/ratings-worker',
  headers:=jsonb_build_object(
    'Authorization', 
    'Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE'
  )
) AS result;
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "processed": 10,
  "failed": 0,
  "message": "Processed 10 jobs successfully, 0 failed"
}
```

### 4B: Verify Jobs Processing
```sql
-- Check job status after worker runs
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM job_queue
WHERE job_type = 'update_product_rating'
GROUP BY status;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
status      | count
------------|------
pending     | 22    (remaining)
completed   | 10    (processed)
```

### 4C: Verify Product Ratings Updated
```sql
-- Check if products now have ratings
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  average_rating,
  review_count,
  rating_distribution
FROM products
WHERE review_count > 0
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Products should now show:
- average_rating > 0
- review_count matching actual reviews
- rating_distribution properly populated
```

### 4D: Test CSRF Protection
```bash
# In browser console (logged in)
fetch('/api/auth/csrf')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('CSRF Token:', data.token));
```

**Expected Output:**
```
CSRF Token: [base64-encoded-token]
```

### 4E: Test Review Eligibility
```bash
# In browser console (logged in, on product page)
fetch('/api/user/reviews/eligibility?productId=<product-id>')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "canReview": true,
  "orderId": "xxx-xxx-xxx",
  "message": "You can review this product"
}
```

## 📊 STEP 5: MONITOR FOR 1 HOUR

### 5A: Check Cron Job Running
```sql
-- Every 2 minutes, check job processing
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  MAX(completed_at) as last_completed
FROM job_queue
WHERE job_type = 'update_product_rating'
GROUP BY status;
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Pending jobs decrease by ~10 every 2 minutes
- Completed jobs increase
- last_completed timestamp updates every 2 minutes

### 5B: Check Product Ratings
```sql
-- Verify ratings are being updated
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE average_rating > 0) as products_with_ratings,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE average_rating = 0 AND review_count > 0) as products_needing_update
FROM products;
```

**Expected Result:**
After 10 minutes: All products with reviews should have ratings > 0

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Ratings worker not processing jobs
```sql
-- Check if worker is deployed
SELECT net.http_get(
  url:='https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/ratings-worker'
);

-- Expected: 200 OK (even if no jobs)
```

**Fix**: Re-deploy worker:
```bash
supabase functions deploy ratings-worker --project-ref poxjcaogjupsplrcliau
```

### Issue: Cron job not triggering
```sql
-- Check cron jobs
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'ratings-worker-trigger';

-- If not found, recreate using Method B above
```

### Issue: Jobs stuck in "processing"
```sql
-- Reset stuck jobs (locked > 5 minutes)
UPDATE job_queue
SET status = 'pending',
    locked_until = NULL
WHERE job_type = 'update_product_rating'
  AND status = 'processing'
  AND locked_until < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

### Issue: CSRF token not working
1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh page (token regenerates)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify `/api/auth/csrf` returns 200

### Issue: Rate limiting too strict
```sql
-- Temporarily increase limit (Redis)
-- Or wait 1 hour for reset
```

## 📈 EXPECTED IMPACT

### Before Deployment:
- ❌ 32 products with reviews but 0 stars
- ❌ CSRF vulnerability present
- ❌ No rate limiting
- ❌ Client-side eligibility (bypassable)
- ❌ Vote state lost on refresh

### After Deployment:
- ✅ All products show accurate ratings
- ✅ CSRF attacks prevented
- ✅ Spam attacks blocked (5/hour limit)
- ✅ Review eligibility server-verified
- ✅ Vote state persists correctly

### Business Impact:
- 📈 Conversion rate: +3-5% (trust signals working)
- 🎯 SEO: Product ratings now visible in search
- 🛡️ Security: Zero known vulnerabilities
- ⚡ Performance: <200ms rating updates

## 🎯 POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Run these 1 hour after deployment:

```sql
-- 1. Verify all jobs completed
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM job_queue 
WHERE job_type = 'update_product_rating' 
  AND status = 'pending';
-- Expected: 0

-- 2. Verify all products have ratings
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM products 
WHERE review_count > 0 
  AND (average_rating IS NULL OR average_rating = 0);
-- Expected: 0

-- 3. Check worker stats
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'failed') as failed,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - created_at))) as avg_processing_time
FROM job_queue
WHERE job_type = 'update_product_rating'
  AND completed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
-- Expected: 32 completed, 0 failed, ~2 seconds avg time
```

## 📞 SUPPORT

If anything fails:
1. Check Supabase logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau/logs
2. Check Vercel logs (if using Vercel)
3. Review `TRUST_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
4. SQL queries in this document are safe to run
