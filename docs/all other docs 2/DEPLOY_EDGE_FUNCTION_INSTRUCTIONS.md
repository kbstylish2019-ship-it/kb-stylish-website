# TOGGLE JWT VERIFICATION

## In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to: Edge Functions ‚Üí review-manager ‚Üí Settings
2. Find: "Verify JWT" toggle
3. **Turn OFF** (as you mentioned you'll do this)

**Why**: This allows the function to handle authentication internally using the dual-client pattern

---

# TESTING AFTER DEPLOYMENT

## Test 1: Guest User (No Auth)
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/review-manager' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "action": "fetch",
    "filters": {
      "productId": "e2353d46-b528-47e1-b3c3-46ec2f1463c8"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected**: Returns empty reviews (no approved reviews yet)

## Test 2: Authenticated User (shishir)
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://poxjcaogjupsplrcliau.supabase.co/functions/v1/review-manager' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer SHISHIR_USER_JWT' \
  -d '{
    "action": "fetch",
    "filters": {
      "productId": "e2353d46-b528-47e1-b3c3-46ec2f1463c8"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected**: Returns his pending review (because it's his own)

## Test 3: Product Page
1. Log in as shishir
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/product/nail-polish`
3. Scroll to reviews

**Expected**:
