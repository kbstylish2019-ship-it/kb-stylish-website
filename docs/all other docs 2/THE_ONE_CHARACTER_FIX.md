# ⚛️ THE ONE CHARACTER FIX

## THE BUG

**File**: `src/components/admin/OnboardingWizardClient.tsx`
**Line**: 373
**The Problem**: Changed `5` → `6` (ONE CHARACTER!)

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (broken)
const handleNextStep = () => {
  if (state.currentStep < 5) {  // Wrong limit!
    setState(prev => ({ ...prev, currentStep: prev.currentStep + 1 }));
  }
};

// ✅ AFTER (fixed)
const handleNextStep = () => {
  if (state.currentStep < 6) {  // Correct limit!
    setState(prev => ({ ...prev, currentStep: prev.currentStep + 1 }));
  }
};
```

## WHY IT WAS BROKEN

When Specialties was added as Step 4:
- Steps increased from 5 to 6 ✅
- Button validation updated ✅
- Render logic updated ✅
- **BUT**: `handleNextStep()` limit NOT updated ❌

**Result**:
- On Step 5: `5 < 5` = FALSE
- Handler exits without incrementing step
- You stay stuck on Step 5
- Button looks enabled but does nothing

## TEST NOW

```bash
Visit: http://localhost:3000/admin/stylists/onboard

Steps:
1-4: Complete as normal ✅
5: Select services → Click Next
6: Should advance to Review page ✅ FIXED!
```
