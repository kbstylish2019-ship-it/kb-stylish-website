2. Note load time in DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Refresh page immediately
4. Note load time again

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ First load: ~200-500ms (cache miss, fetches from database)
- ‚úÖ Second load: ~50-100ms (cache hit, served from Redis)
- ‚úÖ Server logs show "source: database" then "source: cache"

**Verify Cache**:
```bash
# Check Redis cache keys (via Upstash Dashboard or CLI)
KEYS curation:*

# Should return:
# curation:trending:20
# curation:brands:6
# curation:rec:[UUID]:4
```

## üìä ANALYTICS VERIFICATION

### Test 11: Event Analytics Dashboard

**Query**: Top clicked trending products (last 7 days)
```sql
SELECT 
  target_id as product_id,
  COUNT(*) as click_count
FROM public.curation_events
WHERE curation_type = 'trending_products'
  AND event_type = 'click'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY target_id
ORDER BY click_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected**: List of product UUIDs with click counts

### Test 12: CTR Calculation

**Query**: Click-through rate for recommendations
```sql
WITH clicks AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) as click_count
  FROM public.curation_events
  WHERE curation_type = 'product_recommendations'
    AND event_type = 'click'
),
views AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) as view_count
  FROM public.curation_events
  WHERE curation_type = 'product_recommendations'
    AND event_type = 'view'
)
SELECT 
  click_count,
  view_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * click_count / NULLIF(view_count, 0), 2) as ctr_percentage
FROM clicks, views;
```

**Expected**: CTR percentage (e.g., 2.5%)

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: "Trending Products" section empty

**Symptoms**: Section doesn't appear on homepage

**Possible Causes**:
1. Week 1 migrations not deployed
2. Edge Function not deployed
3. No products in database
4. Redis connection failure

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check migrations
supabase db push

# Check Edge Function
curl "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/get-curated-content?action=fetch_trending_products&limit=20"

# Check database
psql "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.products WHERE is_active = true;"
```

### Issue 2: Click tracking not working

**Symptoms**: No events in `curation_events` table

**Possible Causes**:
1. Edge Function not deployed
2. Invalid event types
3. Network errors

**Fix**:
```bash
# Test tracking directly
curl -X POST "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/get-curated-content?action=track_event" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_type":"click","curation_type":"trending_products","target_id":"test-uuid"}'

# Check response for errors
```

### Issue 3: TypeScript errors

**Symptoms**: Build fails with type errors

**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify imports
# TrendingProduct, FeaturedBrand, ProductRecommendation should be imported from @/lib/apiClient

# Run type check
npm run type-check
```
