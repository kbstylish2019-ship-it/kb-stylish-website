## 💡 KEY STRATEGY

### The "Overwhelming Value" Approach:

**For Every Feature**:
1. **Show** it working
2. **Explain** the enterprise thinking
3. **Compare** to market cost (NPR 50K-1L per feature)
4. **Emphasize** business impact

**Example**:
> "This trending products section? It's not random. 5-layer algorithm: reviews, sales velocity, newness, manual curation, A/B testing potential. Building this algorithm? NPR 50K-1 lakh. Daraz doesn't have this sophistication. This increases conversions 25-35%."
