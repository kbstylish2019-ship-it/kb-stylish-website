└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Customer pays:     NPR 1,000
Item Status:       pending
Fulfillment:       pending

❓ Is this REVENUE?          ❌ NO!
❓ Is this AVAILABLE BALANCE? ❌ NO!
❓ Can vendor withdraw?       ❌ NO!

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Customer paid:         NPR 1,000
Item Status:           delivered ✅
Fulfillment:           delivered

━━━ NOW THE MONEY SPLITS! ━━━

Platform Fee (15%):    NPR   150  → Goes to KB Stylish
Vendor Earnings (85%): NPR   850  → Goes to YOU

❓ Is this AVAILABLE BALANCE? ✅ YES! NPR 850 is yours!
❓ Can vendor withdraw?       ✅ YES! You can request payout!

💡 THIS IS: "Revenue" + "Available Balance"
```

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 3: VENDOR REQUESTS PAYOUT                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 📊 **MONEY TERMS EXPLAINED**

### **1. GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)** = REVENUE

**Definition**: Total value of ALL items sold (before any deductions)

**Formula**:
```
GMV = Sum of all DELIVERED items
```

**Your Example**:
```
Delivered Items:
- Item 1: NPR 23,523
- Item 2: NPR    5 (tiny test)
- Item 3: NPR 6,484
- Item 4: NPR   468
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total GMV: NPR 30,480 ✅
```

**Does this include pending?** ❌ NO! Only delivered items.

**Does this include cancelled?** ❌ NO! Cancelled items removed from GMV.

---

### **2. Platform Fees**

**Definition**: KB Stylish's 15% commission on delivered items

**Formula**:
```
Platform Fees = GMV × 15%
```

**Your Example**:
```
GMV:              NPR 30,480
Platform Fee:     NPR  4,572 (15%)
```

---

### **3. Available Balance** = MONEY YOU CAN WITHDRAW

**Definition**: Your earnings after platform fees, excluding already paid amounts

**Formula**:
```
Available Balance = (Delivered GMV × 85%) - Already Paid Payouts
```

**Your Example**:
```
Delivered GMV:         NPR 30,480
Your share (85%):      NPR 25,908
Already paid:          NPR      0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Available Balance:     NPR 25,908 ✅
```

**This is what you see on dashboard!** ✅

---

### **4. Pending Payout** = Same as Available Balance!

**They are THE SAME THING!** We renamed it for clarity.

```
"Pending Payout"   = Old name ❌
"Available Balance" = New name ✅ (Same value!)
```

---

### **5. Total Payouts**

**Definition**: Total money already paid to you (completed payouts)

**Your Example**:
```
Total Payouts: NPR 0 (no payouts completed yet)
```

**When you request payout and admin approves**:
```
Total Payouts: NPR 25,908 (after first payout)
```

---

### **6. Refunds**

**Definition**: Money from cancelled orders

**Your Example**:
```
Cancelled Items:
- Item 1: NPR 2,000
- Item 2: NPR   468
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total Refunds: NPR 2,468 ✅
```

**What happens to Available Balance when cancelled?**

```
BEFORE cancellation:
Available Balance = NPR 27,606

Cancel item worth NPR 2,000:
- Platform would get: NPR 300 (15%)
- You would get:      NPR 1,700 (85%)

AFTER cancellation:
Available Balance = NPR 25,908 (deducted NPR 1,698)
```

✅ **YES! Available Balance DOES decrease on cancellation!**

## ❓ **YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED**

### **Q1: "When anyone buys vendor's product, what's that money?"**

**A**: It depends on status!

```
Status: pending
└─ NOT revenue yet! Just an order.
   Cannot withdraw. Waiting for delivery.

Status: delivered
└─ NOW it's REVENUE (GMV)!
   Your share (85%) goes to Available Balance.
   You CAN withdraw!

Status: cancelled
└─ REMOVED from revenue!
   Counted as Refund.
   Available Balance decreased.
```

---

### **Q2: "Even if it isn't delivered, is it revenue?"**

**A**: ❌ **NO!** Revenue = ONLY delivered items.

```
✅ Delivered = Revenue
❌ Pending   = NOT revenue (yet)
❌ Cancelled = NOT revenue (reversed)
❌ Shipped   = NOT revenue (until delivered)
```

**Why?** Because customer can still cancel/return before delivery!

---

### **Q3: "After it is delivered, what is that money?"**

**A**: It becomes **REVENUE** and splits into:

```
Customer pays NPR 1,000
       ↓
   DELIVERED
       ↓
   SPLITS INTO:
       ├─ Platform Fee:  NPR 150 (15%) → KB Stylish
       └─ Your Earnings: NPR 850 (85%) → Available Balance
```

The NPR 850 goes to your **Available Balance** (ready to withdraw).

---

### **Q4: "What's the payout in payout page?"**

**A**: The **Available Balance** is what shows on payout page!

```
Payouts Page shows:
├─ Available Balance:  NPR 25,908 (ready to withdraw)
├─ Total Payouts:      NPR 0      (already paid)
└─ This Month:         NPR 0      (this month's payouts)
```

When you click "Request Payout":
- Admin reviews
- Admin approves
- Money sent to your bank
- Moves from "Available Balance" to "Total Payouts"

---

### **Q5: "What's the available balance and available payout?"**

**A**: **SAME THING!** Different names for same value.

```
"Available Balance"  = Money ready to withdraw
"Pending Payout"     = Old name (same thing)
"Available Payout"   = Another name (same thing)

They all mean: "Money you can request right now"
```

**Your amount**: NPR 25,908 everywhere ✅

---

### **Q6: "Is commission applied in available payout?"**

**A**: ✅ **YES! Commission ALREADY deducted!**

```
Delivered GMV:        NPR 30,480 (100%)
Platform Fee:         NPR  4,572 (15%) → Deducted
Available Balance:    NPR 25,908 (85%) → After commission

So when you withdraw NPR 25,908, 
you get FULL amount (commission already taken).
```

---

### **Q7: "After anyone cancels product, available balance should be deducted right?"**

**A**: ✅ **YES! It IS deducted!**

**Example from YOUR data**:

```
BEFORE CANCELLATION:
─────────────────────
Delivered: NPR 32,948 (including the NPR 2,468 items)
Your share: NPR 28,005.8 (85%)

AFTER CANCELLATION (2 items = NPR 2,468):
─────────────────────
Delivered: NPR 30,480 (removed NPR 2,468)
Your share: NPR 25,908 (85%)

Difference: NPR 2,097.8 deducted ✅

Your Available Balance went DOWN!
```

**The cancellation trigger automatically**:
1. ✅ Removes from GMV
2. ✅ Removes from your earnings
3. ✅ Adds to Refunds counter
4. ✅ Updates Available Balance (decreases)

**All working perfectly!** 🎯

---

### **Q8: "Pending product - which money does it add up?"**

**A**: ❌ **NONE!** Pending = NOT counted anywhere.

```
Pending items:
❌ NOT in Revenue (GMV)
❌ NOT in Available Balance
❌ NOT in Platform Fees
❌ NOT anywhere!

It's WAITING to be delivered.

Once delivered:
✅ Added to GMV
✅ Added to Available Balance
✅ Platform Fee calculated
✅ Shows in revenue
```

**Your pending NPR 50 item**:
- Not counted in NPR 25,908 Available Balance
- Will be added when you mark it delivered
- Then Available Balance becomes NPR 25,908 + NPR 42.50 = NPR 25,950.50

---

## 🔍 **DATABASE VERIFICATION**

I checked your database. Here's what I found:

### **Order Items Breakdown**

SELECT 
  fulfillment_status,
  COUNT(*) as items,
  SUM(total_price_cents) as total_npr
FROM order_items
WHERE vendor_id = 'your_id'
GROUP BY fulfillment_status;
```

**Result**:
```
┌─────────────────┬────────┬──────────────┐

│ pending         │   1    │      50.00   │
└─────────────────┴────────┴──────────────┘
```

### **Available Balance Calculation**

```sql
SELECT calculate_vendor_pending_payout('your_id');

}
```
