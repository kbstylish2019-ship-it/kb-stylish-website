**Generated**: October 18, 2025  
**Target Scale**: 10,000 concurrent users  
**Total Questions**: 527  
**Domain**: Customer Journey (Authentication → Purchase → Post-Purchase)

---

## ⚡ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Domain Scope
The Customer Journey encompasses every interaction a customer has with the KB Stylish platform from first visit to post-purchase review. This includes:
- **Authentication Flow**: Sign up, login, password reset, session management
- **Product Discovery**: Browse, search, filter, category navigation, product details
- **Shopping Experience**: Cart management (guest + authenticated), wishlist, favorites
- **Checkout Process**: Address management, payment gateway integration (eSewa, Khalti)
- **Order Management**: Order tracking, status updates, cancellation requests
- **Post-Purchase**: Review submission, photo uploads, helpful votes, vendor replies
- **Profile Management**: Account settings, address book, order history

### Critical Risk Areas Identified

**🔴 SEVERITY: CRITICAL**
1. **Guest Cart → Authenticated Cart Merge**: Complex session handoff with potential data loss
2. **Payment Gateway Security**: eSewa/Khalti integration with signature verification
3. **Inventory Reservation**: Race conditions during concurrent checkouts
4. **RLS Policy Gaps**: Potential data leakage in cart/order queries
5. **Session Fixation**: Guest token to JWT transition vulnerabilities

**🟡 SEVERITY: HIGH**
1. **Optimistic Update Rollback**: Cart state synchronization failures
2. **Order Processing Pipeline**: Async job failures leaving orders in limbo
3. **Review Spam/Abuse**: Insufficient purchase verification
4. **Mobile UX**: Checkout flow on 320px viewports
5. **Performance**: N+1 queries in cart details, product listings

**🟢 SEVERITY: MEDIUM**
1. **Discount Code Validation**: Client-side only validation
2. **Image Upload**: No virus scanning, size limit enforcement
3. **Error Messages**: Some leak internal system details
4. **Accessibility**: Incomplete keyboard navigation
5. **Logging**: Insufficient audit trail for customer actions

**RLS Policies on Orders:**
- ✅ Customers view own: `auth.uid() = user_id`
- ✅ Vendors view own products: `vendor_id = auth.uid()`
- ⚠️ **CONCERN**: Broad `authenticated` SELECT policy may leak data

### Edge Function Map

#### 1. `cart-manager` (CRITICAL PATH)
**Authentication**: Dual-mode (JWT + guest token)  
**Endpoints**: 
- `POST /cart-manager` with `action` parameter
  - `get` - Fetch cart with items
  - `add` - Add item to cart
  - `update` - Update item quantity
  - `remove` - Remove item
  - `clear` - Clear entire cart
  - `merge` - Merge guest cart to user cart (on login)

**Security Model**:
- User client: JWT validation via `userClient.auth.getUser()`
- Service client: Bypasses RLS for guest cart operations
- Guest token: Custom header `x-guest-token`

**Critical Functions Called**:
- `get_cart_details_secure(p_user_id, p_guest_token)`
- `add_to_cart_secure(p_user_id, p_guest_token, p_variant_id, p_quantity)`
- `merge_carts_secure(p_user_id, p_guest_token)`

**Known Issues**:
- ⚠️ No rate limiting per guest token
- ⚠️ Guest token is client-generated (crypto.randomUUID())
- ⚠️ Price snapshots may drift from current price

#### 2. `create-order-intent` (PAYMENT GATEWAY)
**Authentication**: Required (JWT)  
**Flow**:
1. Verify user authentication
2. Fetch user's cart via `get_cart_details_secure`
3. Validate cart has items (products OR bookings)
4. Calculate total (product_total + booking_total + shipping)
5. Initiate payment with gateway (eSewa/Khalti)
6. Store payment intent in DB
7. Reserve inventory via `reserve_inventory_for_payment`
8. Return gateway payment URL + form fields

**Payment Gateways**:
- **eSewa**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- **Khalti**: Server-to-server initiation, returns `pidx` + payment URL

**Security Measures**:
- ✅ Amount stored in paisa (cents) to prevent float errors
- ✅ 30-minute payment intent expiry
- ✅ Inventory soft-reservation
- ⚠️ **RISK**: No user rate limiting (spam orders)

#### 3. `verify-payment` (CALLBACK HANDLER)
**Authentication**: None (webhook/callback)  
**Flow**:
1. Receive callback from payment gateway
2. Verify signature (eSewa HMAC / Khalti lookup API)
3. Lookup payment intent by `external_transaction_id`
4. Validate amount matches
5. Create order via `process_order`
6. Clear cart
7. Confirm bookings
8. Enqueue fulfillment jobs

**Critical Validations**:
- ✅ Signature verification prevents tampering
- ✅ Amount comparison (gateway vs DB)
- ✅ Idempotency (check if order already created)
- ⚠️ **RACE CONDITION**: Multiple callbacks may create duplicate orders

#### 4. `review-manager` (TRUST ENGINE)
**Authentication**: Optional (public fetch, auth submit)  
**Actions**:
- `fetch` - Paginated review list with filters
- `submit` - Submit review (requires purchase verification)

**Filters**:
- `productId`, `rating`, `verified`, `hasPhotos`, `hasReply`, `sortBy`

**Security**:
- ✅ Purchase verification via `submit_review_secure` RPC
- ✅ Input sanitization (HTML strip, max length)
- ✅ One review per product per user (UNIQUE constraint)
- ⚠️ **SPAM RISK**: No rate limiting on submissions

#### 5. `order-worker` (ASYNC JOB PROCESSOR)
**Authentication**: Service role (cron-triggered)  
**Responsibilities**:
- Process pending orders
- Handle payment verification failures
- Requeue stale jobs
- Update fulfillment status

**Failure Modes**:
- ⚠️ Job stuck in processing state (no timeout)
- ⚠️ Payment verification timeout leaves order in limbo
- ⚠️ Inventory reservation expires before order creation

### Frontend Architecture Map

#### State Management
```
Zustand Stores:
├── cartStore (src/lib/store/cartStore.ts)
│   ├── Optimistic updates with rollback
│   ├── Server synchronization
│   ├── Guest token management
│   └── Cart merge on login
│
└── decoupledCartStore (src/lib/store/decoupledCartStore.ts)
    ├── Separate products & bookings
    ├── Derived totals
    └── Used in checkout flow
```

#### Critical User Flows

**Flow 1: Guest Browsing → Add to Cart**
```
1. User lands on site (no auth)
2. localStorage checks for existing guest_token
3. If none, generate crypto.randomUUID() and store
4. User clicks "Add to Cart" on product
5. cartStore.addItem(variantId, qty, productDetails)
   ├── Optimistic: Add to local state
   ├── API: POST /cart-manager {action: 'add', variant_id, quantity}
   │   └── Headers: x-guest-token: <uuid>
   ├── Success: Replace optimistic with server data
   └── Failure: Rollback to snapshot
6. Cart badge updates in header
```

**Flow 2: Guest Login → Cart Merge**
```
1. User clicks "Sign In" in header
2. AuthModal opens (src/components/features/AuthModal.tsx)
3. User enters credentials
4. Form submits to signIn(formData) server action
5. Server action:
   ├── supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()
   ├── Non-blocking: merge_carts_secure(user_id, guest_token)
   └── Redirect to '/' (don't wait for merge)
6. Client-side:
   ├── cartStore detects auth change (useEffect)
   ├── Calls fetchCart() to get merged cart
   └── Updates UI with merged items
```

**Flow 3: Checkout → Payment**
```
1. User navigates to /checkout
2. CheckoutClient renders:
   ├── ProductList (from decoupledCartStore.productItems)
   ├── BookingDetails (from decoupledCartStore.bookingItems)
   ├── ShippingForm (address validation)
   └── OrderSummary (cost breakdown)
3. User fills address, selects payment method (eSewa/Khalti)
4. Clicks "Place Order"
5. handleSubmit():
   ├── Validate address fields
   ├── POST /create-order-intent {payment_method, shipping_address}
   ├── Response: {gatewayPaymentUrl, formFields, paymentIntentId}
   ├── If eSewa: Render hidden form, auto-submit to gateway
   └── If Khalti: Redirect to payment_url
6. User completes payment on gateway
7. Gateway redirects to /payment/callback?provider=X&...
8. Callback page:
   ├── Calls /verify-payment edge function
   ├── On success: Redirect to /order-confirmation
   └── On failure: Redirect to /checkout with error
```

**Flow 4: Order Tracking**
```
Currently INCOMPLETE:
- No dedicated "My Orders" page
- No order status API endpoint
- No real-time status updates
- Order confirmation page is static HTML

⚠️ CRITICAL GAP: Customers cannot track orders post-purchase
```

**Flow 5: Write Review**
```
Currently INCOMPLETE:
- No "Write Review" button on order history
- Review form exists but no clear entry point
- Purchase verification works (order_id required)
- No photo upload implemented

⚠️ GAP: Review submission flow not integrated with orders
```

### Integration Points & Data Flow

#### Critical Path: Checkout to Order Creation
```
Frontend (CheckoutClient)
  └→ Edge Function (create-order-intent)
      ├→ Database RPC (get_cart_details_secure)
      │   └→ Returns: cart + items + bookings
      ├→ Payment Gateway API
      │   ├→ eSewa: HMAC signature generation
      │   └→ Khalti: Server-to-server initiation
      ├→ Database (payment_intents INSERT)
      └→ Database RPC (reserve_inventory_for_payment)
          └→ Updates: inventory_reservations table

Payment Gateway
  └→ User completes payment
      └→ Callback: /payment/callback?...
          └→ Edge Function (verify-payment)
              ├→ Gateway Verification
              │   ├→ eSewa: POST /transaction/status
              │   └→ Khalti: POST /epayment/lookup
              ├→ Database (payment_intent UPDATE status)
              ├→ Database RPC (process_order)
              │   ├→ Creates: orders table entry
              │   ├→ Creates: order_items entries
              │   ├→ Updates: inventory (decrement stock)
              │   ├→ Updates: booking_reservations → bookings
              │   └→ Clears: cart + cart_items
              └→ Async Job Queue (order_worker)
                  └→ Enqueues: fulfillment notifications

Frontend
  └→ Redirected to: /order-confirmation?payment_intent_id=...
      └→ Static success page (no actual order data fetched)
```

**Failure Points**:
1. **Payment gateway timeout** → Payment intent expires → Inventory reservation lost
2. **Callback missed** → Order never created → Cart still full → Inventory reserved
3. **process_order RPC fails** → Payment succeeded but no order → Customer charged
4. **Cart merge race** → Items lost during login
5. **Concurrent checkout** → Same inventory reserved twice

## 🚨 KNOWN RISKS & ASSUMPTIONS

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Order Tracking Gap**
   - **Risk**: Customers cannot view order status post-purchase
   - **Impact**: Support tickets, customer frustration, lost trust
   - **Assumption**: Order confirmation page is placeholder
   - **Recommendation**: Build `/profile/orders` page with real-time status

2. **Review Integration Gap**
   - **Risk**: Review system exists but not accessible from orders
   - **Impact**: Low review participation, poor trust signals
   - **Assumption**: Integration deferred to post-MVP
   - **Recommendation**: Add "Write Review" button on order items

3. **Guest Token Security**
   - **Risk**: Client-generated UUIDs can be predicted
   - **Impact**: Cart hijacking, inventory manipulation
   - **Assumption**: UUID collision risk is acceptable
   - **Recommendation**: Server-generate guest tokens with CSPRNG

4. **Payment Callback Race Conditions**
   - **Risk**: Multiple callbacks can create duplicate orders
   - **Impact**: Double-charging customers, inventory errors
   - **Assumption**: Payment gateways don't send duplicate callbacks
   - **Recommendation**: Implement idempotency keys in `verify-payment`

5. **Inventory Reservation Timeout**
   - **Risk**: Reservations expire before payment completes
   - **Impact**: User pays for out-of-stock items
   - **Assumption**: 30-minute window is sufficient
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor reservation timeout rate, adjust TTL

### System Limitations Acknowledged

- **Single Currency**: Only NPR supported, multi-currency not implemented
- **Email Notifications**: Not confirmed to be working
- **SMS Notifications**: Not implemented
- **Real-time Updates**: Order status changes not pushed to client
- **Websockets**: Not used for live cart synchronization
- **Background Jobs**: Simple cron-based, not enterprise queue (Bull, Sidekiq)

### Testing Assumptions

- Unit tests exist for cart store but coverage unknown
- Integration tests mentioned in docs but not verified
- End-to-end tests (Playwright) exist but may be outdated
- Load testing not performed at 10K concurrent users
- Payment gateway testing done in sandbox only
