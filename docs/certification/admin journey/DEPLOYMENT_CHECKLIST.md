## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Final Backup Verification (2 min)
```bash
# Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups
# Verify:
✓ Latest backup exists (<24 hours old)
✓ Backup status: Successful
✓ Backup size: Reasonable (not corrupted)
```

### Step 2: Apply Migration (3 min)

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
```bash
1. Navigate to: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open migration file: supabase/migrations/20250117180000_fix_p0_admin_assertions.sql
3. Copy entire contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" button
6. Wait for "Success" message
7. Verify no error messages in output
```

**Option B: Supabase CLI**
```bash
# From project root
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migration
supabase migration up --db-url "$DB_URL"
```

### Step 3: Verification Queries (2 min)
```sql
-- Run these immediately after migration

-- QUERY 1: Verify all 5 modified functions have assert_admin()
SELECT 
  routine_name,
  routine_definition LIKE '%private.assert_admin%' as has_assert_admin
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name IN (
  'approve_payout_request',
  'reject_payout_request',
  'get_admin_payout_requests',
  'admin_create_stylist_schedule',
  'admin_update_stylist_schedule'
)
AND routine_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY routine_name;

-- Expected: All 5 rows should have has_assert_admin = true

-- QUERY 2: Verify functions still have proper signatures
SELECT 
  routine_name,
  pg_get_function_arguments(oid::regprocedure) as arguments,
  routine_type
FROM information_schema.routines r
JOIN pg_proc p ON p.proname = r.routine_name
WHERE routine_name IN (
  'approve_payout_request',
  'reject_payout_request',
  'get_admin_payout_requests',
  'get_audit_logs',
  'admin_create_stylist_schedule',
  'admin_get_all_schedules',
  'admin_update_stylist_schedule'
)
AND routine_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY routine_name;

-- Expected: All 7 functions exist with correct signatures (no changes)

-- QUERY 3: Check for any unexpected errors in recent logs
SELECT 
  created_at,
  error_message,
  error_code
FROM supabase_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
AND error_message IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected: No critical errors, maybe a few test failures (acceptable)
```

### Step 4: Smoke Tests (5 min)

**Test 1: Admin Dashboard Loads**
```bash
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to /admin/dashboard
3. Verify page loads without errors
4. Check browser console for errors (none expected)
```

**Test 2: Payout Approval Works**
```bash
1. Navigate to /admin/payouts
2. If test request exists, click "Approve"
3. Enter payment reference (optional)
4. Submit
5. Verify success message
6. Check that request status updated
```

**Test 3: Audit Logs Accessible**
```bash
1. Navigate to /admin/audit-logs
2. Apply any filter (category, date range)
3. Verify logs display
4. Check pagination works
5. Expand log details
```

**Test 4: Vendor Cannot Access Admin Functions** (Security Test)
```bash
1. Logout from admin account
2. Login as vendor
3. Attempt to navigate to /admin/dashboard
4. Verify redirect to home page (403 error)
5. Check browser console for proper error handling
```

### Step 5: Monitor Error Rates (30 min)

**Immediate Monitoring (First 5 minutes)**
```bash
# Watch Supabase logs in real-time
# Dashboard → Logs → Database

Filter for:
- Error code: 42501 (insufficient_privilege)
- Function names: approve_payout_request, reject_payout_request, etc.

Expected:
✓ Some 42501 errors from non-admin users (normal)
✗ Zero 42501 errors from known admin accounts
✗ Zero "Function not found" errors
✗ Zero syntax errors
```

**Extended Monitoring (30 minutes)**
```bash
Metrics to Watch:
1. Error Rate: Should remain < 1% for admin functions
2. Latency p95: Should increase < 5ms
3. Success Rate: Should be > 99% for admin operations
4. Advisory Lock Contention: Should be near zero

Alert Thresholds:
🚨 CRITICAL: Error rate > 10% → Immediate rollback
⚠️ WARNING: Error rate > 2% → Investigate
ℹ️ INFO: First vendor-level lock wait (expected behavior)
```

---

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

### Trigger Conditions
Execute rollback if ANY of these occur:
- Error rate > 10% on any admin function
- Any admin reports complete lockout
- Migration fails to apply
- Verification queries fail
- Critical functionality broken

### Rollback Steps (5 min)
```sql
-- IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK: Restore original functions

BEGIN;

-- Copy-paste original function definitions from migration file comments
-- (Each function has "ORIGINAL:" comment with old definition)

-- Example for approve_payout_request:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.approve_payout_request(...)
RETURNS jsonb
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
  -- [PASTE ORIGINAL DEFINITION FROM MIGRATION COMMENTS]
$$;

-- Repeat for all 5 modified functions

COMMIT;

-- Verify rollback successful
SELECT routine_name, routine_definition LIKE '%v_is_admin%' as has_manual_check
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'approve_payout_request';
-- Expected: has_manual_check = true (reverted to old code)
```

### Post-Rollback
- [ ] Re-run smoke tests (should pass)
- [ ] Document rollback reason

## 🎯 VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### Quick Health Check (Run Anytime)
```sql
-- One-liner: Verify all functions are secure
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE routine_definition LIKE '%assert_admin%' OR routine_definition LIKE '%user_has_role%') as secure_count,
  COUNT(*) as total_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) = COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE routine_definition LIKE '%assert_admin%' OR routine_definition LIKE '%user_has_role%') 
    THEN '✅ ALL SECURE'
    ELSE '❌ VULNERABILITIES PRESENT'
  END as status
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name IN (
  'approve_payout_request',
  'reject_payout_request',
  'get_admin_payout_requests',
  'get_audit_logs',
  'admin_create_stylist_schedule',
  'admin_get_all_schedules',
  'admin_update_stylist_schedule'
)
AND routine_schema = 'public';

-- Expected: secure_count = 7, total_count = 7, status = '✅ ALL SECURE'
```

### Detailed Function Audit
```sql
-- Show all admin functions with their security status
SELECT 
  routine_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN routine_definition LIKE '%private.assert_admin%' THEN '✅ Uses assert_admin()'
    WHEN routine_definition LIKE '%user_has_role%' AND routine_definition LIKE '%expires_at%' THEN '✅ Uses user_has_role() with expires_at'
    WHEN routine_definition LIKE '%user_has_role%' THEN '⚠️ Uses user_has_role() (check expires_at)'
    ELSE '❌ NO ADMIN CHECK'
  END as security_status,
  CASE 
    WHEN routine_definition LIKE '%pg_try_advisory_xact_lock%' THEN '🔒 Has locking'
    ELSE ''
  END as has_locking,
  security_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%admin%'
  OR routine_name IN ('approve_payout_request', 'reject_payout_request', 'get_admin_payout_requests', 'get_audit_logs')
AND routine_schema = 'public'
AND security_type = 'DEFINER'
ORDER BY routine_name;
```

## 📞 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

### Critical Issues
- **Security Incident**: Rollback immediately, investigate offline
- **Complete Admin Lockout**: Use Supabase service role to restore access
- **Database Corruption**: Restore from backup (< 1 hour old)

### Escalation Path
1. **Warning** (Error rate > 2%): Monitor closely, prepare rollback
2. **Critical** (Error rate > 10%): Execute rollback immediately
3. **Emergency** (Admin lockout): Service role access + manual fixes
