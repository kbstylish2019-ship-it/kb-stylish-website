# ADMIN JOURNEY - DOCTRINE OF INQUIRY
**Generated**: October 19, 2025  
**Target Scale**: 10,000 concurrent users  
**Total Questions**: 550+  
**Criticality**: Platform-Critical & Governance-Critical

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Admin Journey represents the **highest-privilege tier** of the KB Stylish platform, encompassing complete platform governance, user management, vendor oversight, financial operations, and system configuration. Admin access is the **most sensitive security boundary** in the entire system.

### Scope of Admin Authority

Admins have unrestricted access to:
- **User Management**: View, ban/unban, role assignment, password resets across ALL users
- **Vendor Management**: Application approval/rejection, suspension, commission rates, performance metrics
- **Financial Operations**: Payout approval/rejection, transaction reconciliation, refund processing
- **Platform Analytics**: Revenue metrics, growth KPIs, Governance Engine data, export capabilities
- **System Configuration**: Feature flags, commission rates, payment gateway settings, email templates
- **Audit Logs**: Complete visibility into platform events (role-based filtering)
- **Content Curation**: Featured brands, stylists, product recommendations, specialty management
- **Service Management**: Admin-created services, scheduling, availability configuration
- **Order Management**: View all orders, dispute resolution, manual order creation
- **Customer Support**: Ticket management, user communications, escalation workflows

### Critical Risk Areas

1. **Authentication & Authorization** - Admin role verification, JWT validation, RLS enforcement
2. **Financial Integrity** - Payout approval workflow, commission calculations, fraud prevention
3. **Data Privacy** - PII access controls, GDPR compliance, audit trail completeness
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Self-modification prevention, role assignment validation
5. **Audit Trail Gaps** - Incomplete logging, tamper-proof guarantees, retention policies
6. **System Configuration Safety** - Change validation, rollback capabilities, impact analysis
7. **Emergency Response** - Incident handling, platform maintenance mode, communication protocols

### Key Findings During Analysis

✅ **Strengths Identified:**
- Comprehensive RLS policies with admin role checks
- Dedicated audit logging infrastructure (3 tables: audit_log, user_audit_log, service_management_log)
- Role-based audit log access (admin, auditor, super_auditor)
- SECURITY DEFINER functions with explicit admin assertions
- Dual-client pattern for Edge Functions (userClient + serviceClient)
- Encrypted storage for sensitive vendor payment data

⚠️ **Potential Vulnerabilities Requiring Verification:**
- Admin self-modification prevention completeness
- Audit log tamper-proof guarantees
- Commission rate change validation and limits
- Payout balance verification edge cases
- Emergency access procedures and logging
- API rate limiting for admin endpoints
- Concurrent admin action conflict resolution

#### Key RLS Policies for Admin Access

**Pattern: Admin Full Access**
```sql
-- Example: vendor_profiles
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all vendor profiles" 
ON vendor_profiles FOR ALL 
USING (user_has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'))
WITH CHECK (user_has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));
```

**Pattern: Admin Read-Only**
```sql
-- Example: user_audit_log
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all audit logs"
ON user_audit_log FOR SELECT
USING (user_has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));
```

**Pattern: Admin + Owner**
```sql
-- Example: bookings
CREATE POLICY "Admins have full access to bookings"
ON bookings FOR ALL
USING (user_has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

CREATE POLICY "Customers view own bookings"
ON bookings FOR SELECT
USING (customer_user_id = auth.uid());
```

#### Critical Database Functions

**Authentication Enforcement:**
```sql
private.assert_admin() → SECURITY INVOKER
├── Validates: auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
├── Validates: user_has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin') = TRUE
├── Raises: '42501' error if unauthorized
└── Called by: All SECURITY DEFINER admin functions

public.user_has_role(user_uuid, role_name) → SECURITY DEFINER
├── Checks: user_roles JOIN roles WHERE is_active AND expires_at > NOW()
└── Returns: BOOLEAN
```

**Admin Dashboard:**
```sql
private.get_admin_dashboard_stats_v2_1(p_user_id) → SECURITY DEFINER
├── Auth: Calls assert_admin() equivalent inline
├── Queries: auth.users (requires DEFINER), metrics.platform_daily
├── Returns: JSONB with platform_overview, today, last_30_days
└── Called by: admin-dashboard edge function
```

**User Management:**
```sql
public.suspend_user(p_user_id, p_duration_days, p_reason) → SECURITY DEFINER

└── Prevention: Cannot suspend self (checked in edge function)

public.activate_user(p_user_id) → SECURITY DEFINER
├── Auth: PERFORM private.assert_admin()
├── Clears: banned_until = NULL
└── Logs: user_audit_log
```

**Vendor Management:**
```sql
public.approve_vendor_application(p_vendor_id, p_admin_notes) → SECURITY DEFINER
├── Updates: verification_status = 'verified'
├── Assigns: vendor role via user_roles
├── Logs: service_management_log
└── Notifications: Vendor notified

public.suspend_vendor(p_vendor_id, p_reason) → SECURITY DEFINER
├── Updates: banned_until = 'infinity'
├── Cascade: Deactivates ALL vendor products
├── Returns: products_deactivated count
└── Logs: user_audit_log + service_management_log
```

**Payout Management:**
```sql
public.approve_payout_request(p_request_id, p_payment_reference, p_admin_notes) → SECURITY DEFINER
├── Validates: Balance check
├── Creates: payouts record
├── Updates: payout_requests.status = 'approved'
├── Updates: payout_requests.reviewed_by = auth.uid()
└── Returns: {success, message, payout_id}

### 5. End-to-End Flow Diagrams

Tracing complete data flows for critical admin operations:

#### Flow 1: Admin Login → Dashboard View
```
USER ACTION: Admin navigates to /admin/dashboard
↓
FRONTEND (Server Component):
├── Next.js loads dashboard/page.tsx
├── createServerClient() with cookies
├── await supabase.auth.getUser()
├── Extract: user.user_metadata.user_roles || user.app_metadata.user_roles
├── Validate: userRoles.includes('admin')
├── If NOT admin → redirect('/')
├── If authenticated: getSession() for access_token
↓
API CALL: fetchAdminDashboardStats(access_token)
├── POST to admin-dashboard edge function
├── Headers: Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
↓
EDGE FUNCTION (admin-dashboard):
├── Verify JWT via verifyUser(authHeader, userClient)
├── Extract roles from JWT: user.user_metadata.user_roles
├── Check: roles.includes('admin')
├── If NOT admin → return 403
├── Call: userClient.rpc('get_admin_dashboard_stats_v2_1')
↓
DATABASE (Public Wrapper → Private Function):
├── Public wrapper captures auth.uid()
├── Calls: private.get_admin_dashboard_stats_v2_1(p_user_id = auth.uid())
├── Private function validates:
│   ├── IF p_user_id IS NULL → RAISE 42501
│   ├── IF NOT user_has_role(p_user_id, 'admin') → RAISE 42501
│   └── Queries auth.users (requires SECURITY DEFINER)
├── Aggregates from metrics.platform_daily
├── Returns JSONB: {platform_overview, today, last_30_days}
↓
RESPONSE PATH:
├── Edge function returns {success: true, data: stats}
├── Frontend receives stats
├── Renders: AdminStatCard components with live data
└── UI UPDATE: Dashboard displays platform metrics

SECURITY CHECKPOINTS:
✓ Server-side auth check before page render
✓ JWT validation in edge function
✓ Role check in edge function
✓ Database-level admin assertion
✓ RLS policies enforce data isolation
```

#### Flow 2: Vendor Application Approval
```
USER ACTION: Admin clicks "Approve" on pending vendor

AUDIT TRAIL:
✓ service_management_log records admin action
✓ vendor_profiles.application_reviewed_by tracks who approved
✓ user_roles.assigned_by tracks role assignment
✓ All changes have timestamp (created_at, updated_at)
```

#### Flow 3: Payout Approval with Balance Verification
```
USER ACTION: Admin reviews payout → Expands details → Approves
↓
FRONTEND (PayoutRequestsTable):
├── Display: Available balance vs requested amount
├── Warning: If balance < requested amount

├── createClient() with cookies
├── await supabase.auth.getUser()
├── If auth error → return {success: false}
├── Call: supabase.rpc('approve_payout_request', {...})
↓
DATABASE FUNCTION: approve_payout_request(...)
├── SECURITY DEFINER
├── Auth: PERFORM private.assert_admin()
├── Transaction BEGIN

RESPONSE PATH:
├── Server action returns result
├── revalidatePath('/admin/payouts')
├── Frontend: alert(result.message)
├── window.location.reload() to refresh list
└── [TODO: Vendor notification of approved payout]

FINANCIAL INTEGRITY CHECKS:
✓ Balance calculated from delivered orders only
✓ Platform fees deducted (commission_rate)
✓ Previous payouts subtracted
✓ Transaction ensures atomicity
✓ FOR UPDATE lock prevents race conditions
✓ Admin action logged with details
```

#### Flow 4: User Suspension with Duration
```
USER ACTION: Admin suspends user with duration & reason
↓
FRONTEND (UsersPageClient):
├── handleSuspend(user)
├── Prevention: IF user.id === currentUserId → Error toast, RETURN
├── Prompt: Duration in days (default 7, empty = permanent)
├── Prompt: Optional reason
├── Call: suspendUser(user.id, durationDays, reason)
↓
API CLIENT: POST /api/admin/users/suspend
↓
API ROUTE:
├── Verify admin role from session
├── Additional check: userId !== session.user.id (self-suspension)
├── Call database function
↓
DATABASE FUNCTION: suspend_user(p_user_id, p_duration_days, p_reason)
├── SECURITY DEFINER
├── Auth: PERFORM private.assert_admin()
├── Transaction BEGIN
├── Calculate: banned_until = 
│   └── IF p_duration_days → NOW() + (p_duration_days || ' days')::INTERVAL
│   └── ELSE 'infinity'
├── UPDATE auth.users SET banned_until, updated_at = NOW()
├── WHERE id = p_user_id AND deleted_at IS NULL
├── IF NOT FOUND → RETURN {success: false, message: 'User not found'}
├── INSERT INTO user_audit_log:
│   ├── user_id = auth.uid() (admin performing action)
│   ├── action = 'user_suspended'
│   ├── resource_type = 'user', resource_id = p_user_id
│   ├── new_values = JSONB {banned_until, reason, duration_days}
│   ├── ip_address, user_agent from request
│   └── created_at = NOW()
├── Transaction COMMIT
├── RETURN {success: true, banned_until}
↓
RESPONSE PATH:
├── Update local state: user.banned_until, user.status = 'banned'
├── Toast: "User suspended successfully"
└── [TODO: User email notification]

SECURITY SAFEGUARDS:
✓ Double-check prevents self-suspension (frontend + backend)
✓ Audit log captures who, what, when, why
✓ Transaction prevents partial state
✓ Reason stored for accountability
```

#### Flow 5: Audit Log Query (Role-Based Filtering)
```
USER ACTION: Admin queries audit logs with filters
↓
FRONTEND (AuditLogsClient):
├── Filters: category, severity, date range, pagination
├── API: POST /api/admin/audit-logs/view
├── Body: {category, severity, startDate, endDate, limit, offset}
↓
API ROUTE:
├── Extract session, determine user role
├── Query user_roles: super_auditor > auditor > admin
├── Build query based on role:
│   ├── super_auditor: ALL logs (no filtering)
│   ├── auditor: ALL categories EXCEPT own actions
│   └── admin: ONLY governance + configuration EXCEPT own actions
├── Apply user filters (category, severity, dates)
├── Redact sensitive fields:
│   ├── admin: details = NULL for security/data_access categories
│   └── auditor/super_auditor: Full access
├── Query: private.service_management_log JOIN auth.users
├── Pagination: LIMIT + OFFSET
↓
DATABASE:
├── RLS: No public access to private.service_management_log
├── Access: Via SECURITY DEFINER function only
├── Returns: Array of logs with computed fields
↓
RESPONSE:
├── {success: true, logs, totalCount, userRole}
├── Frontend renders table with role badge
├── Expandable details (JSON)
└── Category/severity badges

AUDIT SEPARATION:
✓ Super auditors see everything (oversight)
✓ Auditors see all except own (accountability)
✓ Admins see limited categories (need-to-know)
✓ Role-based redaction (security/data_access)
✓ Immutable logs (no modification ability)
```

#### Flow 6: Vendor Suspension (Cascading to Products)
```
USER ACTION: Admin suspends vendor with active products
↓
FRONTEND:
├── Warning: Vendor has X pending orders, Y active products
├── Confirm: "Products will be deactivated"
├── Reason input (required)
├── Call: suspendVendor(vendorId, reason)
↓
DATABASE FUNCTION: suspend_vendor(p_vendor_id, p_reason)
├── Auth: PERFORM private.assert_admin()
├── Transaction BEGIN
├── UPDATE auth.users SET banned_until = 'infinity'
├── WHERE id = p_vendor_id
├── Cascade to products:
│   ├── UPDATE products SET is_active = false
│   ├── WHERE vendor_id = p_vendor_id AND is_active = true
│   └── RETURNING COUNT(*) INTO v_products_deactivated
├── Log suspension:
│   ├── service_management_log (admin action)
│   └── user_audit_log (user status change)
├── Transaction COMMIT
├── RETURN {success: true, products_deactivated: count}
↓
IMPACT:
├── Vendor cannot login (banned_until check)
├── All vendor products hidden from catalog
├── Existing orders continue processing
├── Vendor can view but not modify products
└── Reactivation: Products remain inactive until vendor reactivates them

QUESTIONS TO VERIFY:
? Products in active carts - removed or kept?
? Pending orders - auto-cancelled or fulfilled?
? Confirmed orders - vendor can still ship?
? Vendor notification sent?
```

#### Flow 7: Commission Rate Update
```
USER ACTION: Admin updates vendor commission rate
↓
FRONTEND:
├── Display: Current rate (e.g., 15%)
├── Input: New rate (0-100)
├── Validation: Must be 0-100
├── Preview: Impact on pending payouts
↓
API: updateVendorCommission(vendorId, newRateDecimal)
↓
DATABASE:

## ⚠️ KNOWN RISKS & ASSUMPTIONS

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Immediate Verification

1. **Admin Self-Modification Prevention**
   - **Risk:** Admin could remove own role or suspend self
   - **Current State:** Frontend checks in place, backend verification unclear
   - **Action:** Verify backend explicitly prevents self-modification

2. **Audit Log Tamper-Proof Guarantees**
   - **Risk:** Audit logs could be modified post-facto
   - **Current State:** RLS denies public access, but superuser/admin access unclear
   - **Action:** Verify SECURITY DEFINER functions prevent modification

3. **Commission Rate Change Impact**
   - **Risk:** Rate changes could be retroactive or cause calculation drift
   - **Current State:** New orders use new rate, pending payouts unclear
   - **Action:** Verify payout recalculation logic

4. **Concurrent Admin Actions**
   - **Risk:** Race conditions on vendor approval, payout approval, role assignment
   - **Current State:** FOR UPDATE locks in some functions, not all
   - **Action:** Verify all critical functions use proper locking

5. **Performance at Scale**
   - **Risk:** Audit log queries, user list, vendor list could cause performance issues
   - **Current State:** Basic pagination, indexing unclear
   - **Action:** EXPLAIN ANALYZE all admin queries

### Assumptions Made During Analysis

1. **JWT Metadata Sync:** Assumed that `user_metadata.user_roles` is synchronized with `user_roles` table
2. **RLS Enforcement:** Assumed RLS is enforced for ALL clients including service_role (verify!)
3. **Transaction Atomicity:** Assumed database transactions are ACID-compliant
4. **Edge Function Reliability:** Assumed edge functions have 99.9% uptime
5. **Audit Log Completeness:** Assumed ALL admin actions trigger audit logs (verify!)
6. **Session Invalidation:** Assumed suspended users cannot use cached JWTs (verify!)
7. **Cascade Deletes:** Assumed CASCADE rules prevent orphaned records (verify schema!)
8. **Encrypted Fields:** Assumed `_enc` suffix fields are encrypted (verify encryption!)
9. **Notification Delivery:** Assumed email notifications are async and failures don't block operations
10. **Cache Consistency:** Assumed cache invalidation happens on all critical updates

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **No Bulk Operations:** Bulk user/vendor actions would require manual iteration
2. **No Rate Limiting:** Admin endpoints lack per-user rate limits
3. **No Undo Functionality:** No way to revert critical admin actions
4. **Limited Analytics Export:** Analytics export feature not fully implemented
5. **No Audit Log Export:** Audit logs cannot be exported for external SIEM
6. **No Emergency Ban Endpoint:** No fast-path for security incidents
7. **No Commission Change Approval:** Large rate changes lack approval workflow
8. **No Payout Batch Approval:** Payouts must be approved individually
9. **No Real-time Notifications:** Admins not notified of critical events in real-time
10. **No Role Expiry Automation:** Expired roles not auto-cleaned
