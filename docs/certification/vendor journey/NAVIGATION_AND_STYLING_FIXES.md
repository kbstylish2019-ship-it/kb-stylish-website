## 🎯 ISSUES FIXED

### Issue #1: "Become a Vendor" Navigation Visibility ✅

**Problem**: Authenticated customers couldn't see "Become a Vendor" link in navbar

**Root Cause**: 
```typescript
// Capability assignment bug in Header.tsx
// Guests get: apply_vendor ✅
// Authenticated get: apply_vendor ❌ (capability lost on login!)
```

**Expert Panel Decision**: 
- ✅ Give authenticated non-vendors `apply_vendor` capability
- ✅ "My Bookings" stays in profile dropdown (already there)
- ✅ "Become a Vendor" appears for all non-vendors (guests + customers)
- ✅ Existing vendors don't see it (correct filtering)

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// File: src/components/layout/Header.tsx

function capabilitiesToArray(capabilities: any): UserCapability[] {
  const caps: UserCapability[] = [];
  
  // Base capabilities for everyone
  caps.push("view_shop", "view_about", "view_cart");
  
  // Role-based capabilities
  if (capabilities.canAccessAdmin) caps.push("admin_access");
  if (capabilities.canAccessVendorDashboard) caps.push("vendor_access");
  if (capabilities.canAccessStylistDashboard) caps.push("stylist_access");
  if (capabilities.canBookAppointments) caps.push("view_bookings");
  if (capabilities.canViewProfile) caps.push("view_profile");
  
  // NEW: Show "Become a Vendor" to non-vendors only
  if (!capabilities.canAccessVendorDashboard) {
    caps.push("apply_vendor");
  }
  
  return caps;
}
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Guests see "Become a Vendor" (unchanged)
- ✅ Authenticated customers now see "Become a Vendor" (FIXED!)
- ✅ Existing vendors don't see it (correct)
- ✅ "My Bookings" remains in both navbar and profile dropdown for accessibility

### Issue #2: Modal/Dropdown Styling Consistency ✅

**Problem**: Inconsistent background colors across modals and dropdowns
- Some had white backgrounds (hard to read)
- Some had different shades of dark
- No standardized design system

**Examples of Inconsistency**:
```css
/* Different modal backgrounds found */
bg-[#1a1f2e]  /* Some modals */
bg-[#0a0a0a]  /* Some dropdowns */
bg-white      /* WRONG - hard to read! */
bg-white/10   /* Transparent */
```

**Expert Panel Decision**:
- ✅ Standardize on `bg-[var(--kb-surface-dark)]` for all modals
- ✅ Add CSS variable to globals.css
- ✅ Update base DialogContent component
- ✅ Maintain consistent dark theme across app

**Fixes Applied**:

#### 1. Added Design Token
```css
/* File: src/app/globals.css */
:root {
  --kb-surface-dark: #1a1f2e; /* Dark surface for modals/cards */
}
```

#### 2. Updated Base Dialog Component
```typescript
/* File: src/components/ui/custom-ui.tsx */
export function DialogContent({ children, className = '' }: CardProps) {
  return (
    <div className={`bg-[var(--kb-surface-dark)] border border-white/10 rounded-2xl shadow-xl max-w-md w-full mx-4 p-6 ring-1 ring-white/10 ${className}`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ All modals using DialogContent now have consistent dark background
- ✅ Follows dark theme design consistently
- ✅ Easy to update globally via CSS variable
- ✅ Professional, polished appearance

**Components Affected** (automatically fixed via base component):
- ✅ admin/CreateScheduleModal.tsx
- ✅ admin/services/ServiceFormModal.tsx
- ✅ stylist/TimeOffRequestModal.tsx
- ✅ stylist/SafetyDetailsModal.tsx
- ✅ stylist/BookingActionsModal.tsx
- ✅ stylist/ExportModal.tsx

**Note**: Inline modal backgrounds (vendor/RequestPayoutModal, vendor/AddProductModal) already use proper dark styling with `bg-white/5` and border styling, which is acceptable for their use case.
