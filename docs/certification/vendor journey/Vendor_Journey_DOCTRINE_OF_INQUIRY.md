**Generated**: October 18, 2025  
**Target Scale**: 10,000 concurrent users  
**Total Questions**: 650+  
**Criticality**: Trust-Critical & Revenue-Critical

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Domain Overview
The Vendor Journey encompasses the complete lifecycle of vendor partners on the KB Stylish platform, from initial application through ongoing operations. This includes onboarding, product management, order fulfillment, financial settlements, customer interactions, and performance analytics. As a **revenue-critical** and **trust-critical** domain, any failure in the vendor journey directly impacts platform revenue, vendor satisfaction, and customer experience.

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- Vendor registration and KYC verification
- Application state machine (draft → submitted → approved/rejected)
- Onboarding wizard flow (business info, payment methods, first product)
- Product CRUD operations (create, edit, delete, bulk upload, inventory management)
- Order fulfillment workflow (receive, process, ship, track, cancel)
- Payout system (earnings calculation, payout requests, bank verification, payment processing)
- Vendor analytics dashboard (sales metrics, revenue tracking, top products)
- Schedule management for service-based vendors (availability, overrides, holiday blocking)
- Customer communication (review responses, dispute handling, return/refund management)
- Review & rating management (receive reviews, respond publicly, flag inappropriate content)

**Out of Scope:**
- Customer-facing shopping experience (covered in Customer Journey Doctrine)
- Admin vendor management UI (covered in Admin Journey Doctrine)
- Platform-wide trust scores and recommendations (covered in Trust Engine Doctrine)

### Key Risk Areas Identified
**P0 - Critical:**
- Payout calculation accuracy (money MUST be correct)
- Order-product deletion cascade safety (prevent data loss)
- RLS policy enforcement on vendor_profiles, products, payouts
- Bank account data security and PII encryption
- Race conditions in inventory deduction during high concurrency
- Application state machine integrity (prevent unauthorized state transitions)

**P1 - High:**
- Fulfillment status synchronization across order_items and orders
- Product edit impact on in-flight orders (price changes)
- Bulk product upload validation and rollback on errors
- Schedule override conflicts and double-booking prevention
- Vendor-customer communication audit trail

**P2 - Medium:**
- Dashboard metrics performance at scale
- Product image upload size/format validation
- Search and filter performance on vendor orders page
- Notification delivery reliability

**P3 - Low:**
- UI/UX polish on vendor dashboard
- Optional fields validation
- Mobile responsiveness edge cases

### Scale Considerations
At 10,000 concurrent users with an estimated 1,000 active vendors:
- ~500 concurrent product updates
- ~2,000 order items in fulfillment daily
- ~100 payout requests per day
- ~5,000 inventory movements per hour

## NEXT STEPS - HANDOFF TO PHASE 2: FORENSIC RESTORATION

### Immediate Actions (P0 - Before ANY Production Deployment)

**1. Verify Bank Account Encryption**
```sql
-- Execute via MCP to check encryption
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'vendor_profiles' 
AND column_name IN ('bank_account_number', 'tax_id');

-- Check if pg_crypto extension is used
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pgcrypto';
```
**Action:** If not encrypted, implement field-level encryption IMMEDIATELY.

**2. Test Payout Double-Payment Prevention**
```bash
# Simulate concurrent payout approvals
# Create test scenario with same payout_request_id
# Verify only one payout record is created
```
**Action:** Add row-level locking with `SELECT FOR UPDATE` in approve_payout_request.

**3. Verify RLS Policy Enforcement**
```sql
-- Test as vendor A trying to access vendor B's data
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
SET request.jwt.claim.sub = '<vendor_a_uuid>';

SELECT * FROM vendor_profiles WHERE user_id = '<vendor_b_uuid>';
SELECT * FROM payouts WHERE vendor_id = '<vendor_b_uuid>';
```
**Action:** All queries MUST return zero rows.

**4. Test Product Deletion with Active Orders**
```sql
-- Verify soft delete behavior
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM order_items 
  WHERE fulfillment_status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped')
);
```
**Action:** Confirm delete_vendor_product sets is_active=false instead of DELETE.

**5. Test Inventory Race Conditions**
```javascript
// Use k6 or similar to simulate concurrent purchases
import http from 'k6/http';
export default function() {
  // 100 concurrent users buying last item
  http.post('/api/cart/checkout', {product_id: 'test', quantity: 1});
}
```
**Action:** Verify inventory never goes negative, only 1 purchase succeeds.

### High Priority Actions (P1 - Within 1 Week of Deployment)

6. **Load Test Vendor Dashboard** - Verify p95 latency < 500ms with 500 concurrent vendors
7. **Test Fulfillment Status Sync** - Verify order.status updates correctly when all items ship
8. **Implement Metrics Reconciliation Job** - Daily job to sync vendor_realtime_cache with actual data
9. **Test Schedule Double-Booking** - Verify override prevents booking conflicts
10. **Performance Audit All Queries** - Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on all vendor-facing queries

### Medium Priority Actions (P2 - Within 1 Month)

11. Implement bulk product upload with CSV validation
12. Add image upload size/format validation
13. Implement notification preference management
14. Add vendor analytics export (CSV)
15. Mobile responsiveness testing

### Documentation Needed

- **Security Audit Report:** Results of RLS testing, encryption verification
- **Performance Baseline:** Query execution times, p95 latencies for all endpoints
- **Payout Reconciliation Process:** Manual steps for admin to verify payouts
- **Vendor Onboarding Guide:** User-facing documentation
- **API Documentation:** For vendor-facing endpoints

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:** Focus on RPC functions (payout calculations, state machine validation)
**Integration Tests:** End-to-end flows (application → approval → onboarding → first order → payout)
**Load Tests:** 1000 vendors, 500 concurrent operations, 10K products
**Security Tests:** RLS bypass attempts, SQL injection, XSS in product descriptions
**E2E Tests:** Playwright tests for critical vendor workflows

## DOCTRINE COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Generated:** October 18, 2025  
**Domain:** Vendor Journey (Complete Lifecycle)  
**Total Questions:** 650  
**Critical (P0):** 210 questions  
**High (P1):** 170 questions  
**Medium (P2):** 110 questions  
**Low (P3):** 160 questions  

**System Consciousness Achieved:**
- ✅ Database schema verified via MCP (12 core tables, 26 columns in vendor_profiles)
- ✅ RPC functions documented (25+ functions across application, product, payout, analytics)
- ✅ RLS policies verified (5 tables with comprehensive access control)
- ✅ Edge Functions mapped (3 vendor-specific functions)
- ✅ Frontend components traced (15+ React components, 2 server action files)
- ✅ Integration points identified (order fulfillment, payout processing, metrics aggregation)

**Critical Risks Identified:**
1. Bank account data encryption (verification required)
2. Payout double-payment race condition
3. Product deletion cascade safety
4. Inventory overselling under concurrency
5. RLS policy bypass via SECURITY DEFINER functions

**Recommended Immediate Actions:**
1. Verify and implement PII encryption
2. Add row-level locking to payout approval
3. Test RLS policies with bypass attempts
4. Load test inventory system
5. Audit all SECURITY DEFINER functions

**This Doctrine is now ready for Phase 2: Forensic Restoration & Certification Testing.**
