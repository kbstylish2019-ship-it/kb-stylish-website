# ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED - October 20, 2025 (PM Session)

## Issues You Reported

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: SLOT_UNAVAILABLE Error Message (FIXED)

**Your Clarification**: "The slot unavailable thing comes when one user has added a service to cart and it hasn't been 15 minutes. During that time if another person tries to book that specific time then this slot unavailable thing comes up."

**You were 100% correct!** I misunderstood the scenario initially.

**What Was Wrong**:
- User A reserves 9 AM slot (15-minute hold)
- User B tries to book 9 AM ‚Üí Gets technical error: "unrecognized exception condition SLOT_UNAVAILABLE"

**What's Fixed Now**:
- Database function returns friendly error
- User B now sees: **"This time slot is no longer available. Someone else may have just booked it."**

**Files Modified**:
1. `create_booking_reservation()` function - Added user-friendly error message
2. `src/app/api/bookings/create-reservation/route.ts` - Improved error handling

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Stylists Can Book Themselves (FIXED)

**Your Question**: "Also still the same stylist can book his own service I guess. Look whether that is possible right now or not?"

**Answer**: YES, it was possible! **Now FIXED.**

**Test I Ran**:
```sql
-- Tried to create reservation where customer = stylist (both Shishir)
SELECT create_booking_reservation(
  'shishir-id',  -- customer
  'shishir-id',  -- stylist (SAME!)
  ...
);
```

**BEFORE Fix**: ‚ùå Succeeded (bug!)
```json
{"success": true, "reservation_id": "..."}
```

**AFTER Fix**: ‚úÖ Blocked
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Stylists cannot book appointments with themselves",
  "code": "SELF_BOOKING_NOT_ALLOWED"
}
```

**What Was Fixed**:
- Added CHECK constraint to `booking_reservations` table
- Updated function with self-booking validation
- Cleaned up 5 existing test self-bookings
- Added error handling in API route

**Migration**: `fix_self_booking_in_reservations_v3`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #3: React Error (Image 1)

**Error Shown**:
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')
at HeaderClientControls.tsx (64:45)
```

**Status**: This appears to be a **transient Next.js hydration error**, not related to our booking fixes.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Development server caching issue
2. Dynamic import race condition
3. Hot module replacement glitch

**Recommended Fixes** (try in order):
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (clears React dev cache)
2. **Restart dev server**: Stop and restart `npm run dev`
3. **Clear Next.js cache**: Delete `.next` folder and rebuild
4. **Check if error persists** after our booking fixes

**If error persists**, it needs deeper investigation (likely unrelated to bookings).

## Migration Applied

### Migration: `fix_self_booking_in_reservations_v3`

**What it does**:
1. Deletes existing self-booking test data (5 cancelled reservations)
2. Adds CHECK constraint to prevent future self-bookings
3. Updates function to return friendly error

**Rollback** (if needed):
```sql
ALTER TABLE booking_reservations 
DROP CONSTRAINT prevent_self_booking_reservation;

-- Then recreate old function
```

## Testing Guide

### Test #1: SLOT_UNAVAILABLE (Concurrent Booking)

**Steps**:
1. Open browser window A (User A)
2. Open incognito window B (User B)
3. Both users go to booking page for Shishir
4. User A: Select Hair Color, pick Oct 23 at 9 AM, add to cart ‚úÖ
5. User B: Try to book SAME slot (Hair Color, Oct 23, 9 AM)
6. **Expected**: User B sees: "This time slot is no longer available. Someone else may have just booked it." ‚úÖ

### Test #2: Self-Booking Prevention

**Steps**:
1. Log in as Shishir (stylist account)
2. Go to `/book-a-stylist`
3. Try to book appointment with yourself
4. **Expected**: Error message: "Stylists cannot book appointments with themselves" ‚úÖ
