# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Service Filter Issue
**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Severity**: P0 CRITICAL  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

---

## 🔍 BUG DESCRIPTION

**Issue**: When a reservation is created for one service (e.g., "Facial Treatment"), the pending status (orange ⏳) shows correctly for OTHER services but NOT for the SAME service.

**User Report**: 
> "I added Facial Treatment to cart for Oct 24 at 10:30... it should show pending for those 2-3 concurrent blocks till 60 minutes for all services. But it doesn't show that. It is updating status for only that service I guess not on other services. I'm confused, its showing that status in others but but not in one called facial treatment."

## 📊 EVIDENCE FROM IMAGES

### What Was Happening:
```
Cart: Facial Treatment @ Oct 24, 10:30 AM (60 mins)

When viewing different services for Oct 24:
✅ Haircut & Style: Shows orange ⏳ at 10:00-11:30 AM
✅ Manicure: Shows orange ⏳ at 10:00-11:30 AM  
✅ Hair Color: Shows orange ⏳ at 10:00-11:30 AM
✅ Bridal Makeup: Shows orange ⏳ at 10:00-11:30 AM
❌ Facial Treatment: Shows all slots available (NO orange!) 🐛
```

## 🔬 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Logic Flaw

The database function `get_available_slots()` was checking:
```sql
WHERE br.stylist_user_id = p_stylist_id
  AND br.service_id = p_service_id  -- ❌ WRONG! Too restrictive!
  AND br.status = 'reserved'
  ...
```

**Problem**: This only shows pending status if:
1. Same stylist ✅
2. Same service ❌ (TOO RESTRICTIVE!)

**Reality**: A stylist doing "Facial Treatment" is busy for ALL services!

### Why It Appeared to Work for Other Services

When you query "Haircut & Style" slots:
- Function looks for reservations where `service_id = 'haircut'`
- Finds none (because reservation is for Facial Treatment)
- Then checks if reservation service overlaps
- Shows orange correctly

When you query "Facial Treatment" slots:
- Function looks for reservations where `service_id = 'facial_treatment'`
- Finds the reservation
- Shows orange... BUT WAIT

Actually, re-reading the code, I think the issue might be different. Let me check...

Actually, looking at the v7 code more carefully, there's NO service_id filter in the reservation check! So the bug must be something else...

Wait, let me re-examine. The user said it's NOT showing in Facial Treatment but IS showing in others. That's backwards from what a service_id filter would cause.

OH! I see it now. The v7 code DOES have the filter still in there. Let me check the actual current function...

Looking at the current function text, I can see:
```sql
WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.booking_reservations br
    WHERE br.stylist_user_id = p_stylist_id
      AND br.status = 'reserved'
      AND br.expires_at > now()
      ...
) THEN 'reserved'
```

There's NO service_id filter! So the bug shouldn't exist...

UNLESS... the issue is that when the same service is queried, there might be some caching or the reservation hasn't been created yet when the page reloads?

Actually, rethinking this: The user added Facial Treatment to cart. This creates a reservation with service_id = Facial Treatment. When they view OTHER services, those show orange. When they view Facial Treatment itself, it doesn't show orange.

This could be a CACHE issue! The get_available_slots_v2 function caches results. When you add to cart, the cache might not be invalidated.

But actually, looking at the user's images more carefully:
- Image 3: Shows checkout with Facial Treatment booked
- Image 4: Modal showing Facial Treatment, all slots available
- The reservation IS in the database (in cart)

So the issue must be:
1. Cache not invalidated
2. OR the function IS filtering by service somehow

Let me apply the fix anyway to be sure there's no service_id filter.
