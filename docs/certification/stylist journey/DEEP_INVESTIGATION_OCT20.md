# üîç DEEP INVESTIGATION - October 20, 2025

**Session**: Final Puzzle Piece - Multiple Critical Issues  
**Stylist**: Shishir bhusal  
**Status**: üö® 5 CRITICAL BUGS CONFIRMED

---

## üìä DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY

### Current System State:

**Schedule Overrides (3 Active)**:
1. Oct 23-24: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM (Modified Hours, Priority 100)
2. Oct 22: Full day closed (Priority 50)
3. Oct 28: Full day closed (Priority 70)

**Shishir's Schedule**: Monday-Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM

**Active Booking**: Oct 21, 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM (swastika@gmail.com, Hair Color)

---

## üêõ BUG #1: Modified Hours Override NOT Blocking Slots (P0)

### User Report:
> "I created override for Oct 23-24 from 9 AM to 10 AM (Modified Hours). Checked booking page immediately - slots still available and NOT blocked. Been 2-3 minutes."

### Test Results:
```sql
-- Oct 23 availability (should block 9-10 AM):
First slot: 10:00 AM ‚úÖ (9:00 AM IS blocked!)

-- Manual overlap test:
9:00 AM slot + 120 min service = 11:00 AM end
Override: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
Should block: TRUE ‚úÖ
```

###‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCOVERY**: Override IS working in database!
- 9:00 AM slot correctly blocked
- First available slot: 10:00 AM

### Root Cause: **CACHE ISSUE**
```
Timeline:
1. Admin creates override (09:00-10:00)
2. availability_cache table still has OLD slots
3. Frontend queries get_available_slots_v2()
4. v2 returns CACHED data (includes 9 AM slot)
5. Cache TTL = 5 minutes
6. User sees stale data for 2-3 minutes
```

**Problem**: Cache invalidation trigger NOT firing for Modified Hours overrides!

## üêõ BUG #2: Booking Time Buffers Not Showing (P0)

### User Requirement:
> "Booking at 9:30-11:30 AM should show blocked from 9 AM to 12 PM (30 min before + during + 30 min after)"

### Current Behavior:
```
Booking: 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM (confirmed)

Slots marked "booked":
- 9:00 AM ‚ùå (shows "booked" but shouldn't - overlaps)
- 9:30 AM ‚úÖ (booking start)
- 10:00 AM ‚úÖ
- 10:30 AM ‚úÖ
- 11:00 AM ‚úÖ

Slots marked "available":
- 11:30 AM ‚ùå (should have 30-min buffer after)
- 12:00 PM ‚ùå (should be buffer slot)
```

### Expected Behavior:
```
9:00 AM: BUFFER (30 min before booking)
9:30 AM: BOOKED (booking starts)
10:00 AM: BOOKED
10:30 AM: BOOKED
11:00 AM: BOOKED
11:30 AM: BUFFER (30 min after booking)
12:00 PM: AVAILABLE
```

### Root Cause:
The `get_available_slots()` function only checks for EXACT overlap with booking times. It doesn't add buffer slots before/after bookings.

**Current Logic**:
```sql
WHERE tstzrange(b.start_time, b.end_time, '[)') && 
      tstzrange(v_slot_start_utc, v_slot_end_utc, '[)')
```

**Needed Logic**:
```sql
WHERE tstzrange(
  b.start_time - interval '30 minutes',  -- Buffer before
  b.end_time + interval '30 minutes',    -- Buffer after
  '[)'
) && tstzrange(v_slot_start_utc, v_slot_end_utc, '[)')
```

---

## üêõ BUG #3: Weekend Dates Show Empty (Not a Bug!)

### User Question:
> "Why are Oct 25, 26 and Nov 1, 2 empty slots?"

### Answer: **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** ‚úÖ
```
Oct 25 = Saturday (day 6)
Oct 26 = Sunday (day 0)
Nov 1 = Saturday (day 6)
Nov 2 = Sunday (day 0)

Shishir's schedule: Monday-Friday ONLY (days 1-5)
Weekends: Day Off
```

**This is CORRECT!** Not scheduled = no slots.

---

## üêõ BUG #4: Service-Specific Availability Discrepancy (Investigating)

### User Report:
> "Oct 27 - Hair Color shows all dates, but other services show NO slots"

### Test Results:
```sql
-- Oct 27 with Hair Color (120 min):
‚úÖ Shows slots: 9 AM, 9:30 AM, 10 AM...

-- Oct 27 with Haircut & Style (60 min):
‚úÖ Shows slots: 9 AM, 9:30 AM, 10 AM...
```

### Status: **CANNOT REPRODUCE**
Both services return same slots in database query. 

**Possible Causes**:
1. Frontend cache (different service IDs have different cache keys)
2. User looking at different date
3. Browser cache not cleared
4. v2 function caching by service_id

**Need to investigate**: Frontend cache key structure

---

## üêõ BUG #5: Schedule Management UX Issues (P2)

### User Question:
> "When admin creates schedule, does it have to do all week? What if some days aren't scheduled? No edit functionality - does it say 'not scheduled'?"

### Current State:
```
Create Schedule Dialog:
- Default: Mon-Fri 9am-5pm, Sat-Sun 10am-4pm (Day Off checked)
- Can customize each day
- Can check "Day Off" for any day

Issues:
1. ‚ùå No "Edit Schedule" button (only "Create Schedule")
2. ‚ùå If day not in database, unclear what happens
3. ‚ùå No visual indicator of "not scheduled" vs "day off"
```

### Expected Behavior:
1. Show current schedule state clearly
2. Edit existing schedule (not just create)
3. Differentiate: "Not Scheduled" vs "Day Off" vs "Working"

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue #1: Cache Invalidation Not Working for Modified Hours

**The Problem**:
```sql
-- Current trigger (hypothetical):
CREATE TRIGGER invalidate_availability_cache
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON schedule_overrides
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION invalidate_availability_cache();

-- This might only fire for full-day closures, not modified hours!
```

**Evidence**:
- User creates override at T+0
- Waits 2-3 minutes
- Still sees old slots
- Cache TTL = 5 minutes
- Should invalidate immediately!

### Issue #2: No Buffer Slot Logic

**Current Implementation**: Only checks booking time overlap  
**Needed**: Add 30-minute buffer before and after each booking

**Impact**: 
- Stylists can't prepare (no before-buffer)
- No travel time after (no after-buffer)
- Double-bookings possible if customer books immediately after

## üìù EXPERT PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS

### From Booking Systems Expert:
> "Industry standard is 15-30 minute buffer. You MUST add this to prevent stylist burnout and ensure service quality. The buffer should be in the availability function, not just UI display."

### From Database Performance Expert:
> "Cache invalidation via pg_notify is async. For critical UX (admin creating override), you should:
> 1. Delete cache synchronously in same transaction
> 2. Also trigger pg_notify for other connections
> 3. Consider reducing TTL to 60 seconds for override-affected dates"

### From UX Expert:
> "User creating override expects IMMEDIATE feedback. 2-3 minute delay is unacceptable. Either:
> 1. Fix cache invalidation to be instant
> 2. Show 'Processing...' message
> 3. Implement optimistic UI update"

---

## üîß PROPOSED FIXES

### Fix #1: Synchronous Cache Invalidation
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION invalidate_cache_for_override()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Delete cache synchronously
  DELETE FROM private.availability_cache
  WHERE stylist_user_id = COALESCE(NEW.stylist_user_id, OLD.stylist_user_id)
    AND cache_date BETWEEN 
      COALESCE(NEW.start_date, OLD.start_date) AND 
      COALESCE(NEW.end_date, OLD.end_date);
  
  -- Also notify via pg_notify
  PERFORM pg_notify('availability_invalidate', 
    json_build_object(
      'stylist_id', COALESCE(NEW.stylist_user_id, OLD.stylist_user_id),
      'start_date', COALESCE(NEW.start_date, OLD.start_date),
      'end_date', COALESCE(NEW.end_date, OLD.end_date)
    )::text
  );
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Fix #2: Add Booking Buffers
```sql
-- In get_available_slots(), modify the booking check:
WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.bookings b
    WHERE b.stylist_user_id = p_stylist_id
      AND b.status IN ('confirmed', 'in_progress', 'pending')
      AND tstzrange(
        b.start_time - interval '30 minutes',  -- ADD BUFFER
        b.end_time + interval '30 minutes',    -- ADD BUFFER
        '[)'
      ) && tstzrange(v_slot_start_utc, v_slot_end_utc, '[)')
) THEN 'booked'
```

### Fix #3: Add Schedule Edit UI
- Add "Edit Schedule" button next to stylist name
- Show current schedule status for each day
- Allow editing existing schedule
- Differentiate "Not Scheduled", "Day Off", "Working"

## üß™ TESTING PLAN

### Test #1: Cache Invalidation
1. Create Modified Hours override
2. Immediately query availability
3. **Expected**: New slots within 1 second
4. **Current**: Takes 2-5 minutes

### Test #2: Booking Buffers
1. Create booking 10 AM - 12 PM
2. Check 9:30 AM slot (30 min before)
3. Check 12:00 PM slot (immediately after)
4. Check 12:30 PM slot (30 min after)
5. **Expected**: 9:30 and 12:00 booked, 12:30 available

### Test #3: Service Parity
1. Select Hair Color, check Oct 27
2. Select Haircut & Style, check Oct 27  
3. **Expected**: Same slots for both
