## 🚨 CRITICAL BUG #2 FIXED

### Issue: Facial Treatment Not Showing Pending Status

**User Report**:
> "I added Facial Treatment to cart for Oct 24 at 10:30... it should show pending for those 2-3 concurrent blocks for all services. But it doesn't show that in Facial Treatment itself!"

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Other services (Haircut, Manicure, Hair Color) showed orange ⏳
- ❌ Facial Treatment itself showed all slots available

**Root Cause**: 
The reservation check was potentially caching or not properly checking across all service views.

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
-- Ensured reservation check does NOT filter by service_id
-- A stylist busy with ANY service = ALL services blocked

WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM booking_reservations br
    WHERE br.stylist_user_id = p_stylist_id
      -- NO service_id filter - stylist busy = all blocked!
      AND br.status = 'reserved'
      AND br.expires_at > now()
      ...
) THEN 'reserved'
```

**Migration**: `fix_reservation_check_all_services`

**Cache**: Cleared availability cache to ensure fresh data

## 🎨 UI FIX: Modal Scrolling

**Issue**: Create Schedule modal cut off at bottom (Image 9)
- Effective dates section visible
- Submit button hidden
- Not scrollable

**Fix Applied**:
```tsx
// Added scrollable layout
<DialogContent className="sm:max-w-2xl max-h-[90vh] flex flex-col">
  <DialogHeader className="flex-shrink-0">...</DialogHeader>
  
  <form className="flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
    <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto space-y-4 pr-2">
      {/* Scrollable content */}
    </div>
    
    {/* Fixed footer */}
    <div className="flex gap-3 justify-end pt-2 border-t flex-shrink-0">
      <Button>Create Schedule</Button>
    </div>
  </form>
</DialogContent>
```

**Changes**:
1. Modal max-height: 90vh
2. Content area: scrollable (flex-1 overflow-y-auto)
3. Header: fixed at top (flex-shrink-0)
4. Footer: fixed at bottom (flex-shrink-0)
5. Border-top on button area for visual separation
