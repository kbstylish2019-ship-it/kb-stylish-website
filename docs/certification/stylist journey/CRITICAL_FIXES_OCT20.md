# üö® CRITICAL FIXES - October 20, 2025

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: SLOT_UNAVAILABLE Misunderstanding ‚úÖ FIXED

**What I Thought**: User trying to change their own booking

**What Actually Happens**:
- User A adds booking to cart (15-minute reservation)
- User B tries to book the SAME time slot  
- User B gets: "unrecognized exception condition SLOT_UNAVAILABLE"

**Root Cause**: Function was returning technical error code without user-friendly message

**Fix Applied**:
Updated `create_booking_reservation()` function to return:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "This time slot is no longer available. Someone else may have just booked it.",
  "code": "SLOT_UNAVAILABLE"
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- Database function: `create_booking_reservation()` - Added friendly error message
- API route: `src/app/api/bookings/create-reservation/route.ts` - Improved error handling

### Issue #2: Stylists Can Book Themselves ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Stylists could book appointments with themselves (self-booking)

**Test Results BEFORE Fix**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "reservation_id": "9577828d-06b9-4d49-aa5a-19349f189cfa",
  "customer_name": "Test Self-Booking"
}
```
‚ùå **Self-booking succeeded!**

**Root Cause**: `prevent_self_booking` constraint only existed on `bookings` table, not `booking_reservations` table

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added CHECK constraint to `booking_reservations` table
2. Updated `create_booking_reservation()` function with early check
3. Cleaned up 5 existing self-booking test reservations

```sql
ALTER TABLE booking_reservations
ADD CONSTRAINT prevent_self_booking_reservation
CHECK (customer_user_id <> stylist_user_id);
```

**Test Results AFTER Fix**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Stylists cannot book appointments with themselves",
  "code": "SELF_BOOKING_NOT_ALLOWED"
}
```
‚úÖ **Self-booking blocked!**

**Migration**: `fix_self_booking_in_reservations_v3`

### Issue #3: React useState Error ‚è≥ INVESTIGATING

**Error from Image 1**:
```
Recoverable Error
Switched to client rendering because the server rendering errored:
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')

at HeaderClientControls.tsx (64:45)
```

**Location**: Line 64 in HeaderClientControls.tsx
```typescript
const [mobileOpen, setMobileOpen] = React.useState(false);
```

**Possible Causes**:
1. React import issue
2. Server/Client component mismatch  
3. Hydration error

**Status**: Need to investigate further

- [x] User A reserves slot ‚Üí User B tries same slot ‚Üí Gets friendly error message
- [x] Error shows: "Someone else may have just booked it"
- [x] No technical error codes shown to user

### Test #2: Self-Booking Prevention ‚úÖ
- [x] Database function blocks self-booking
- [x] Returns user-friendly error
- [x] CHECK constraint prevents data corruption
- [x] API route handles error correctly

### Test #3: React Error ‚è≥
- [ ] Identify root cause

## Summary

**Fixed**: 2 out of 3 issues  
**Status**: React error needs investigation  
**Priority**: P1 (doesn't block core functionality)

**Next Steps**:
1. Investigate React error in HeaderClientControls
2. Test booking flow end-to-end
3. Verify all error messages are user-friendly
