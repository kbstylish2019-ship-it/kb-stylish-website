## ‚ö†Ô∏è EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Domain Scope
The Stylist Journey encompasses all functionality enabling professional stylists to offer their services on the KB Stylish platform, from initial onboarding through service delivery and payment. This is a **service-critical** and **trust-critical** domain where failures directly impact:
- **Stylist livelihood** (earnings, bookings, professional reputation)
- **Customer trust** (appointment reliability, service quality)
- **Platform revenue** (commission on bookings)
- **Regulatory compliance** (worker verification, payment processing)

### Key Sub-Systems Analyzed
1. **Stylist Onboarding** - Multi-step promotion workflow with verification
2. **Service Management** - CRUD operations for offered services with custom pricing
3. **Schedule Management** - Weekly templates, overrides, holidays, rate-limiting
4. **Booking System** - Slot generation, conflict detection, reservation, confirmation
5. **Appointment Management** - Calendar views, status updates, completion tracking
6. **Booking Analytics** - Revenue metrics, popular services, retention analytics
7. **Customer Interaction** - Booking notes, communication, special requests
8. **Stylist Earnings** - Transaction history, payout requests, commission structure
9. **Availability Management** - Real-time slot calculation with caching (72x performance)

### Critical Risk Areas Identified

#### üî¥ **CRITICAL (P0) - 148 Questions**
- **Double-Booking Prevention**: GiST index + advisory locks must be bulletproof at scale
- **Schedule Conflict Resolution**: Priority system for overlapping overrides
- **Availability Accuracy**: Cache invalidation must be atomic and immediate
- **Time Zone Handling**: Nepal UTC+5:45 conversions must never fail
- **Payment Security**: Earnings calculations must be precise (no rounding errors)
- **RLS Policy Gaps**: Stylists must only access their own bookings/earnings
- **Privilege Escalation**: Multi-step promotion workflow prevents compromised admin abuse
- **Rate Limiting**: Override budget system prevents DoS via unlimited schedule changes

#### üü° **HIGH (P1) - 186 Questions**
- **Performance Degradation**: Availability cache must maintain 72x improvement under load
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent booking attempts on last available slot
- **Data Consistency**: Booking status changes must propagate correctly
- **UX Failures**: Confusing error messages during booking conflicts
- **Notification Reliability**: Confirmation emails must be sent reliably
- **Analytics Accuracy**: Revenue/booking metrics must match actual data

#### üü¢ **MEDIUM (P2) - 135 Questions**
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Query performance for historical bookings
- **UX Enhancements**: Mobile responsiveness, accessibility improvements
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing API documentation, unclear error codes

#### üîµ **LOW (P3) - 81 Questions**
- **Code Style**: Consistency in error handling patterns
- **Future Enhancements**: Recurring appointments, automated reminders

### Scale Targets
- **10,000 concurrent users** (2,000 stylists √ó 8 daily bookings average)
- **Availability query performance**: <3ms (cached), <150ms (cold)
- **Booking creation latency**: <50ms end-to-end
- **Zero double-bookings**: Atomic conflict detection via advisory locks
- **99.9% cache hit rate**: 5-minute TTL with intelligent invalidation

### Known Architectural Strengths
‚úÖ **GiST indexing** for O(log n) conflict detection  
‚úÖ **Advisory locks** prevent race conditions during booking creation  
‚úÖ **Dual UTC/Local time storage** eliminates timezone bugs  
‚úÖ **72x performance gain** via availability_cache with trigger-based invalidation  
‚úÖ **Multi-step promotion workflow** prevents privilege escalation (CVSS 8.5 fix)  
‚úÖ **Rate-limited overrides** prevent DoS attacks (CVSS 7.5 fix)  
‚úÖ **Immutable audit trail** for schedule changes (compliance)  
‚úÖ **Layered schedule system** (base + overrides with priority resolution)  

### Known Vulnerabilities to Investigate
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cache invalidation race condition** - Multiple concurrent booking creates  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Override priority conflicts** - Two overrides with same priority and overlapping dates  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Timezone edge cases** - DST transitions, midnight boundary crossing  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Buffer time enforcement** - Ensuring 15-minute gaps are never violated  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Auto-cancellation logic** - 24h confirmation window enforcement  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Earnings calculation precision** - Floating-point arithmetic in commission computation  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Schedule override budget exhaustion** - Graceful degradation when limit reached  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Concurrent schedule updates** - Lost update problem with last-write-wins

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN RISKS & ASSUMPTIONS

### Critical Assumptions
1. **Advisory Lock Hash Uniqueness**: Assumes `hashtext()` provides sufficient collision resistance for stylist UUIDs
2. **Cache Trigger Atomicity**: Assumes trigger execution is synchronous and cannot be skipped
3. **Timezone Stability**: Assumes Nepal timezone (UTC+5:45) does not change DST rules
4. **Payment Integration**: Assumes payment system handles refunds; booking system only tracks status
5. **Connection Pool Sizing**: Assumes Supabase connection pool configured for 10K concurrent users

### Known Gaps Requiring Investigation
1. **Cache Race Condition**: Multiple simultaneous cache misses for same slot - ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING prevents duplicate inserts but wasted computation
2. **Override Priority Ties**: Two schedule_overrides with same priority for overlapping dates - resolution logic not documented
3. **Earnings Precision**: Commission calculation may use floating-point - verify INTEGER arithmetic
4. **Auto-Cancellation**: 24h confirmation window enforcement not found in codebase - feature incomplete?
5. **Notification Reliability**: Email delivery failures may result in silent booking confirmation loss

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **Audit Log Growth**: schedule_change_log and service_management_log have no partitioning or archival strategy
2. **Cache Cleanup**: Expired cache entries cleanup job not found - manual VACUUM required?
3. **Historical Data**: No archival strategy for old bookings (>1 year) impacting query performance
4. **Error Code Standardization**: API errors use inconsistent codes (SLOT_UNAVAILABLE vs slot_unavailable)
5. **Monitoring Gaps**: No documented SLAs or alerting thresholds for booking system

## üéØ NEXT STEPS - FORENSIC RESTORATION PHASE

### Immediate Actions (Before Production Launch)
1. **Execute P0 Questions** - All 148 critical questions must be answered with evidence
2. **Fix Double-Booking Risks** - Verify advisory lock, GiST index, cache invalidation under load testing
3. **Timezone Edge Case Testing** - Test DST transitions, midnight boundaries, leap years
4. **Security Audit** - Penetration test RLS policies, input validation, privilege escalation
5. **Load Testing** - Simulate 10,000 concurrent users with booking creation and availability queries
6. **Cache Performance Validation** - Confirm 95%+ hit rate and 2ms p95 latency

### High Priority (P1 - Before Scale-Up)
1. **Performance Optimization** - Address slow queries, add missing indices, optimize cache strategy
2. **Monitoring Implementation** - Set up alerts for cache degradation, double-booking, slow queries
3. **UX Polish** - Fix confusing error messages, add loading states, improve mobile experience
4. **Documentation** - API reference, error code catalog, runbook for common failures

### Medium Priority (P2 - Continuous Improvement)
1. **Analytics Enhancement** - Build stylist performance dashboards, customer retention analysis
2. **Historical Data Management** - Implement archival strategy for old bookings
3. **Code Quality** - Standardize error handling, improve TypeScript strict mode compliance
4. **Advanced Features** - Recurring appointments, automated reminders, dynamic pricing
