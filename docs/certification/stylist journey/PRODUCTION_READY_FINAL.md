## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Timezone Fix:
```sql
-- Before (WRONG - double conversion):
slot_start_local := v_slot_start_utc AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE p_customer_timezone

-- After (CORRECT - single conversion):
slot_display := to_char(v_slot_start_utc AT TIME ZONE p_customer_timezone, 'HH12:MI AM')
```

### Cache Headers:
```typescript
headers: {
  'Cache-Control': 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0',
  'Pragma': 'no-cache',
  'Expires': '0'
}
```

### Creator Badge Logic:
```tsx
{currentAdminId && override.created_by === currentAdminId ? (
  <><Shield className="h-3 w-3" /> Admin</>
) : override.stylist_user_id && override.created_by === override.stylist_user_id ? (
  <><User className="h-3 w-3" /> Stylist Request</>
) : (
  <><Shield className="h-3 w-3" /> Admin</>
)}
```
