Awesome. we've hit the production, our client is putting some products of his for the official launch. everything is good in all of the perspective like functionality, backend, integration everything. no changes needed in those parts. now only thing that needs to be changed is the front-end ui/ux part. 

our client doesnot love how everything is looking right now at all. like he doesnot think it looks like any of the existing framework proven design for multivendor multistylish platform. it does fit for user experience at all. from the simple search bar like which should cover the almost whole length of the navbar. we only have the small search bar. the product section, the hero section. no section for offers. no clear branding. none of the existing proven theme used etc etc.

now we need to completely change the overall branding and the entire look of the website. we have to first start with the home page, the product page and the product detail page. they need to be like almost carbon copy of the already proven multivendor marketplaces like daraz and the vhandaar or so. it need to be like completely copy the entire look with the uniqueness like color, branding and some other unique elements from the kbstylish itself. the existing architecture of the frontend should be almost same as those platforms but the styling, color etc etc should of the kb stylish brand. 

he explicitely said that he's expecting the frontend to be atleast good as https://www.vhandar.com/ but even expecting more from us. we can follow the daraz.com.np and the vhandar to get the inspiration. i'll provide you with the images of how they look like how they feel like how they do the entire fronend and everything. i guess you also have access to web so you can fetch those too. did you get it like we need it better than those itself. 

first analyze all the screenshots of the platform i give you then lets implement all of those. we'll do it step by step first only the home page then product page maybe then the product description. he looks for smallest detail like the product detail should be in bottom, how the image looks everything every smallest detail got it. almost copy from them but in unique way. for the entire operation follow our protocol. first refer to 
UNIVERSAL_AI_EXCELLENCE_PROMPT.md
 and 
SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md
 


here i provided you with the vhadaar's some of the home page's content only, you have to get creative on how to like make all of our content to show like this. first you have to understand about what actually kbstylish is all about. its mainly the salon in kathmandu, and our client is going to the business of the multivendor market place where he will sell saloon products not tshirts or fashion thing. the saloon products like Lilium Herbal Gold Face Scrub 900ml,Astaberry Wine Facial Kit Medium 5 Steps etc etc. also like in a combo(by the combo means like multiple different products in combo for this launch in discounted price if bought in combo something like that.), maybe the chairs etc etc. its not a fashion brand or something like that. he envision like the stylish can be listed in there and when the customer books them they will do in home saloon servies. 

first understand about kb stylish look at the about section everything. first feel it then only implement the unique and proven solution lets go

now another thing to implement is cash on delivery system right now we have npx payment enabled, we update, manage, inventory check, balance upgrade everything from that standpoint i guess. i think i also forgot that but. mainly we have our payment system made but for the cash on delivery, we have to manage every other thing too like how to increse the income of vendor, admin. inventory is i guess is decresed. what do we do like how do we do everything. we have to think deep about that. first you need to know about our existing system on how everything works after checkout page. how tracking of product and everything is done. then you have to do the expert level battle simulation on problem solution everything donot start implementation of the code. just do as our protocol says. first start with ingesting ai excellence prompt #UNIVERSAL_AI_EXCELLENCE_PROMPT.md . do simulation battle everything once all the experts, reviewers etc etc gives green light and according to phase you reach to the implementation phase then only start implementation. lets go. come up with greatest out of the box solution. which makes the system simple not complex. has less breaking points. creates no vulnerability. implementation is easier and faster. go aehad and start with the phase one codebase immersion.
