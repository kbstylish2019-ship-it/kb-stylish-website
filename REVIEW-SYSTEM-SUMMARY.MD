Here’s a complete, end-to-end debrief of what happened, what we changed, what failed, and what I recommend next.

Summary timeline
- Seed script ran into foreign keys and cart uniqueness issues.
- We hardened the seed script to create carts and payment intents correctly before orders.
- Playwright originally tried to run Jest unit tests and blew up with “jest is not defined.”
- We isolated Playwright to only run the E2E spec in tests/.
- E2E runs now start fine and the first test passes, but the “Helpful vote via UI” test fails because the counter doesn’t increment.
- There are still a couple of code hygiene items to clean in the seeder.

What we targeted and why
- Seed a minimal trust scenario to test reviews end-to-end:
  - Create test vendor(s), test customer, product, variant, inventory, a delivered order, and two pre-existing reviews.
  - Write artifact to `supabase/tests/trust_seed.json` so E2E can consume stable IDs.
- Run a Playwright spec that validates:
  - Authenticated buyer can call review-manager submit and a review row is created and moderation/rating job is queued.
  - Helpful vote via the UI increments sharded counters.
  - Self-vote is prohibited via the vote-manager function.
  - Vendor and non-owner vendor reply permissions are enforced.

Changes we made
- Seed script enhancements in [supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts](cci:7://file:///d:/kb-stylish/supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts:0:0-0:0):
  - Created cart first, then payment_intents, then orders to satisfy FK:
    - We now insert into `payment_intents` before inserting `orders` so `orders.payment_intent_id` has a valid FK target.
  - Avoid duplicate-cart failures:
    - Instead of raw insert, we attempt an upsert/fallback select:
      - `.upsert({ user_id: customerId }, { onConflict: 'user_id' }).single()` with fallback to `.select('id').eq('user_id', customerId).maybeSingle()`.
      - Important nuance: On your live DB, `carts.user_id` may not be uniquely indexed, which is why upsert logs “no unique constraint for ON CONFLICT.” The fallback select handled it and unblocked the run.
  - Order creation error guard:
    - After `.insert(...).select('id').single()` we now guard `orderErr`/`order` before using `order.id`.
  - Seed result JSON is written to `supabase/tests/trust_seed.json` and also logged as JSON.

- Playwright configuration:
  - [tests/playwright.config.ts](cci:7://file:///d:/kb-stylish/tests/playwright.config.ts:0:0-0:0):
    - Test isolation: set `testDir: '.'` and `testMatch: ['trust-engine.spec.ts']` so Playwright does NOT pick up Jest unit tests in the repo.
    - Added prod server mode: if `USE_PROD_SERVER=1`, run `npm run build && npm run start` to reduce dev noise.
  - [package.json](cci:7://file:///d:/kb-stylish/package.json:0:0-0:0):
    - Script `"e2e": "playwright test -c tests/playwright.config.ts"` ensures the right config file is used.

What worked
- Seeding
  - Your `npm run seed:trust` now completes successfully:
    - Product created/selected.
    - Variant ensured and inventory set.
    - Cart reused or created for the test customer.
    - Payment intent inserted up-front.
    - Delivered order created referencing the payment intent.
    - Two approved reviews inserted using fake users.
    - `trust_seed.json` written.
- Playwright runner isolation
  - Only [tests/trust-engine.spec.ts](cci:7://file:///d:/kb-stylish/tests/trust-engine.spec.ts:0:0-0:0) runs.
  - Dev-time “jest is not defined” errors are gone.
- E2E Test 1 passes
  - “Review Submission creates pending review and enqueues moderation job” passed.
  - This confirms: authenticated buyer can submit a review through `review-manager` Edge Function; DB has the row; a job to update product rating is queued.

What failed
- E2E Test 2 failed
  - “Voting helpful via UI increments sharded counters”
  - Assertion: `expect(after).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(before + 1)` failed (received `false`).
  - We successfully logged in via UI, navigated, selected the seeded review card, and clicked what the test believes is the “Mark as helpful” button. After 500ms, the shard sum didn’t increase.

Expected vs actual
- Expected:
  - Clicking the UI button should call the voting path and increment `review_vote_shards.helpful_count` for that review ID.
- Actual:
  - No increment observed. This means either:
    - The UI click did not trigger any call to your vote backend.
    - The UI invoked the call but failed silently (e.g., missing auth header, mismatched payload).
    - The UI label or selector differs, and we’re clicking the wrong UI element (less likely as the test would have failed sooner).
    - RLS or service is rejecting the vote but the UI isn’t surfacing the error.

Likely root causes to investigate
- UI wiring for helpful vote:
  - The test expects a button with label `/Mark as helpful/`. A quick repo search didn’t find this exact string, suggesting a mismatch between test and UI.
  - The UI may not be wired to call the `vote-manager` Edge Function with the user’s JWT. If it’s using fetch directly without the Supabase client, the request likely lacks the Authorization header and is rejected by RLS.
- Timing:
  - We wait only 500ms before reading `review_vote_shards`. If the UI triggers an async action that queues work (shouldn’t for shard increment), the delay may be too short. However, shard increment should be immediate and in-band.

Additional environment observations
- Upstash Redis warnings:
  - Initially we saw “[Upstash Redis] The 'url' property is missing or undefined” which indicates code calls something like `Redis.fromEnv()` or `new Redis({ url, token })`.
  - Adding `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to [.env.local](cci:7://file:///d:/kb-stylish/.env.local:0:0-0:0) was correct. Subsequent runs appear to proceed without the warnings (your prior run still showed missing url/token; after adding those two names, they should be resolved).
- Seeder stray code that should be cleaned:
  - In [ensureInventoryLocation(...)](cci:1://file:///d:/kb-stylish/supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts:168:0-195:1) there are stray references to `orderErr`/`order` that don’t belong in that function:
    - [supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts](cci:7://file:///d:/kb-stylish/supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts:0:0-0:0) around lines 183–201 you can see `if (orderErr) ... if (!order) ...` checks. These should be removed. It fortunately didn’t break the seed in your successful run, but it’s error-prone and should be cleaned.

What should happen (correct E2E behavior)
- Seed ensures we have:
  - A product, a variant, enough inventory, delivered order for the customer, and a couple of approved seeded reviews.
- E2E tests should:
  - Log in as the customer, submit a review via `review-manager` → review inserted and rating job queued.
  - Log in as the customer, click “Helpful” on someone else’s review in the product page → `review_vote_shards` helpful_count increments for that review ID.
  - Authenticated customer should be blocked from self-voting (fail with `SELF_VOTE_PROHIBITED`).
  - Vendor owner should be able to reply via `reply-manager`, non-owner vendor should be blocked.

What is happening
- Everything up to the first test passes as expected (auth + review submission).
- UI helpful vote either isn’t calling the backend path correctly or is mismatched with RLS/auth expectations, so the shard counter doesn’t increment.

Recommended deep-dive plan
- Fix the seeder hygiene
  - Remove the stray `orderErr`/`order` references inside [ensureInventoryLocation(...)](cci:1://file:///d:/kb-stylish/supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts:168:0-195:1) in [supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts](cci:7://file:///d:/kb-stylish/supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts:0:0-0:0). They don’t belong and can cause runtime confusion in future edits.
  - For `carts` creation, stop relying on `.upsert(..., { onConflict: 'user_id' })` since your DB doesn’t have a unique index on `user_id` in some environments. Prefer:
    - Try insert, if `23505`, select existing row by `user_id` and proceed.
- Investigate the UI for helpful votes
  - Locate the review card component that renders the “Helpful” or similar button (e.g., `components/product/ReviewCard.tsx` or similar).
  - Verify it calls the `vote-manager` function with the user’s JWT via `supabase.functions.invoke('vote-manager', ...)`.
    - If it uses `fetch` to the function endpoint, switch to the Supabase client so the Authorization header is included automatically.
  - Ensure the button has a stable role/name for Playwright:
    - Update the text or add `aria-label="Mark as helpful"` to match the test, or update the test to match the UI.
  - Add logging or toast on error so we can see if the vote was rejected by RLS.
- Harden the E2E test step for voting
  - Consider increasing the wait from 500ms to, say, 1000ms as a safety margin (though shard increment should be immediate).
  - Better: intercept the network call and assert a 2xx response before checking the DB:
    - `page.waitForResponse(resp => resp.url().includes('/functions/v1/vote-manager') && resp.ok())`
- Optional: Test backend of vote flow directly (like Test 3)
  - As a stopgap, add a backend-only test using `vote-manager` directly (similar to how we test submit in test 1 and self-vote in test 3), to confirm shard increment independently of UI wiring. That will isolate whether the backend path is fine.

Concrete next steps I’d take
- Clean the seeder file:
  - Remove the stray `orderErr`/`order` checks in [ensureInventoryLocation(...)](cci:1://file:///d:/kb-stylish/supabase/tests/seed_trust_engine.ts:168:0-195:1).
  - Change cart creation to insert-first-then-select-on-duplicate pattern (more portable across schema variations).
- Inspect and patch the UI helpful button:
  - Ensure it calls `vote-manager` correctly with Supabase client, and that its label/aria matches the Playwright selector.
  - Add a small success indicator/toast that we can assert in E2E alongside the DB check.
- Re-run E2E with prod server
  - `$env:USE_PROD_SERVER='1'; npm run e2e`

If you want, I can immediately:
- Patch the seeder cleanup.
- Find and fix the helpful vote UI/idempotent call.
- Update the Playwright test to assert the network call and increase the wait to 1s.
- Re-run the suite and report back.

This will get “Voting helpful via UI” to green and give you a robust, production-grade trust engine test harness.
