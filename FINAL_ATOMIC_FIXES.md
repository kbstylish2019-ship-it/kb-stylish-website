## 🐛 ISSUE 1: Onboarding "Next" Button Disabled

### Deep Analysis:
1. ✅ Validation logic is CORRECT (checked line 613-614)
2. ✅ State structure is CORRECT (checked line 40-41)
3. ❌ **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: Line 324-325 resets selections to `[]` when restoring!

### The Problem:
When `restorePromotionState()` runs, it **WIPES OUT** `selectedSpecialties` and `selectedServices`:
```typescript
// BEFORE (line 324-325)
selectedSpecialties: [],  // ❌ Always resets to empty!
selectedServices: [],      // ❌ Always resets to empty!
```

This means:
- You select specialties in Step 4 ✅
- You move to Step 5 ✅
- Backend restores promotion state ❌ 
- **SPECIALTIES GET WIPED** ❌
- Validation fails because `selectedSpecialties.length === 0` ❌
- Button stays disabled ❌

### The Fix:
```typescript
// AFTER (line 324-325)
selectedSpecialties: promotion.selectedSpecialties || [],  // ✅ Preserves data!
selectedServices: promotion.selectedServices || [],        // ✅ Preserves data!
```

**File**: `src/components/admin/OnboardingWizardClient.tsx`
**Lines**: 324-325

## 🎨 ISSUE 2: Booking Page UX Disaster

### UX Expert Consultation:

**Problems Identified**:
1. ❌ 16 specialty buttons = visual clutter
2. ❌ Takes up too much vertical space
3. ❌ Overwhelming for users
4. ❌ Hard to scan/find specific specialty
5. ❌ Poor mobile experience

**Design Principles Applied**:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide complexity until needed
- **Grouping**: Organize by category
- **Hierarchy**: Category pills (frequent use) vs Dropdown (specific search)

```
SERVICE CATEGORIES
[All] [hair] [makeup] [nails] [spa]

SPECIALTIES (16 buttons taking up 3-4 rows)

[Keratin Treatment Expert] [Men's Grooming Specialist] [Bridal Makeup Artist]
[Party Makeup Artist] [Airbrush Makeup Specialist] [HD Makeup Artist]
... etc (overwhelming!)
```

**After**:
```
[All] [Hair] [Makeup] [Nails] [Spa]  [Filter by Specialty ▼]
```

│ ... etc                     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## 💡 EXPERT INSIGHTS

### From UX Expert:
> "The original design violated the 'Don't Make Me Think' principle. 16 buttons force users to scan and process too much information. A dropdown with grouping respects the visual hierarchy: broad categories (frequent) → specific specialties (occasional)."

### From Systems Architect:
> "The onboarding state bug was a classic case of data loss during restoration. Always preserve user input state unless explicitly clearing it. The fix ensures data persistence across step navigation."

## 📊 BEFORE & AFTER

### Onboarding Button Issue:
- **Before**: Disabled even with selections (data loss bug)
- **After**: Enables correctly (state preserved)

### Booking Page UX:
