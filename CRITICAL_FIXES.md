# ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL FIXES - VERIFIED

## Issue 1: specialtyTypes is not defined âœ… FIXED

**Root Cause**: The variable `specialtyTypes` was being used in the useMemo hook before the component had access to it.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added default value: `specialtyTypes = []` in function params
2. Added safety check before using: `specialtyTypes && specialtyTypes.length > 0`

**File**: `src/components/booking/BookingPageClient.tsx`

## Issue 2: Can't click Next after Services âœ… FIXED

**Root Cause**: The validation logic was checking for specialties/services in `canCompletePromotion()` but the Next button on Step 5 (Services) was only checking `state.selectedServices.length === 0`.

**Fix Applied**:
Added validation for Step 3 (Profile):
```typescript
(state.currentStep === 3 && state.profileData.display_name.trim() === '')
```

This ensures each step has proper validation before allowing Next.

**File**: `src/components/admin/OnboardingWizardClient.tsx`
