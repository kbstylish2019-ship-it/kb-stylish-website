## 📊 VERIFICATION QUERIES

### Check Database Migration Status
```sql
-- Verify columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'stylist_profiles' 
AND column_name IN ('deactivated_at', 'deactivated_by');

-- Expected: 2 rows
```

### Check Indexes
```sql
SELECT indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'stylist_profiles' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_stylist%';

-- Expected: 2 rows (idx_stylist_profiles_active, idx_stylist_profiles_featured_active)
```

### Check Trigger
```sql
SELECT tgname 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'check_stylist_active_before_booking';

-- Expected: 1 row
```

### Check Storage Bucket
```sql
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit 
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id = 'avatars';

-- Expected: 1 row (2MB limit, public=true)
```

### Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
AND policyname LIKE '%avatar%';

-- Expected: 5 rows
```
