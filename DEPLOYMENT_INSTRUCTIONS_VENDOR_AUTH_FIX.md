# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS: Vendor Application Auth Fix

**CRITICAL**: Follow these steps IN ORDER. Do not skip steps.

---

## ⚠️ PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] You have read `FORENSIC_AUDIT_VENDOR_AUTH_FAILURE.md`
- [ ] You understand the root cause (auth.uid() context loss)
- [ ] You have access to Supabase project dashboard
- [ ] You have Supabase CLI installed and authenticated
- [ ] You have tested the fix locally (optional but recommended)
- [ ] You have notified team members of deployment

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT

### STEP 1: Apply Database Migration (5 minutes)

**Method A: Using Supabase CLI (RECOMMENDED)**

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd d:\kb-stylish

# Verify you're connected to the correct project
supabase projects list

# Link to project (if not already linked)
supabase link --project-ref poxjcaogjupsplrcliau

# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Expected output: "Applying migration 20251015143000_fix_vendor_application_auth.sql"
```

**Method B: Using Supabase Dashboard (SQL Editor)**

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau/sql/new
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20251015143000_fix_vendor_application_auth.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify success message

**Verification:**

```sql
-- Run this query to verify the migration was successful
SELECT 
    proname as function_name,
    pg_get_function_arguments(oid) as arguments,
    prosecdef as is_security_definer
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'submit_vendor_application_secure';

-- Expected output:
-- function_name: submit_vendor_application_secure
-- arguments: p_user_id uuid, p_application_data jsonb
-- is_security_definer: t
```

If you see the `p_user_id` parameter, ✅ migration successful!

---

### STEP 2: Deploy Edge Function (5 minutes)

**Option A: Deploy Local Version (Uses shared modules)**

```powershell
# Make sure you're in project root
cd d:\kb-stylish

# Deploy the function
supabase functions deploy submit-vendor-application --project-ref poxjcaogjupsplrcliau

# Expected output:
# Deploying Function...
# submit-vendor-application deployed successfully
# Version: 8 (or higher)
```

**Option B: Deploy Inline Version (Create temporary file)**

If you want to deploy the inline diagnostic version (like v7 but with the fix):

1. Create file: `supabase/functions/submit-vendor-application-v8-inline/index.ts`
2. Copy the contents from `RESTORATION_BLUEPRINT_VENDOR_AUTH.md` (Step 2, Option A)
3. Deploy:
   ```powershell
   supabase functions deploy submit-vendor-application-v8-inline --project-ref poxjcaogjupsplrcliau
   ```
4. Rename in dashboard to `submit-vendor-application`

**Verification:**

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau/functions
2. Find `submit-vendor-application`
3. Check version number (should be 8 or higher)
4. Check "Last deployed" timestamp (should be recent)

---

### STEP 3: Test End-to-End (10 minutes)

**Run the test script:**

```powershell
# Make sure you're in project root
cd d:\kb-stylish

# Run test script
.\scripts\test_vendor_application_fixed.ps1

# You'll be prompted for test user credentials
# Use an existing test user or create one first
```

**Expected output:**

```
================================================
Vendor Application Submission Test
================================================

✅ Loaded environment variables from .env.local
✅ Authentication successful
   User ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   Token (first 20 chars): eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

✅ Application submitted successfully!

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Application submitted successfully! Our team will review it within 1-2 business days.",
  "application_state": "submitted"
}

================================================
🎉 TEST PASSED - FIX IS WORKING!
================================================
```

**If test fails:**

1. Check the error message and diagnostics
2. Verify migration was applied (see Step 1 verification)
3. Verify Edge Function was deployed (see Step 2 verification)
4. Check Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
5. Review `FORENSIC_AUDIT_VENDOR_AUTH_FAILURE.md` for troubleshooting

---

### STEP 4: Verify in Admin Dashboard (5 minutes)

1. Log into your application as an admin user
2. Navigate to Admin → Vendors → Applications
3. Find the test application you just submitted
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Application appears in list
   - ✅ Status shows "submitted" or "pending"
   - ✅ Business name matches test data
   - ✅ No error indicators

**Database Verification:**

```sql
-- Check the test application in database
SELECT 
    user_id,
    business_name,
    business_type,
    application_state,
    application_submitted_at,
    created_at
FROM vendor_profiles
WHERE application_submitted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes'
ORDER BY application_submitted_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### STEP 5: Monitor Production (15 minutes)

**Check Edge Function Logs:**

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/poxjcaogjupsplrcliau/logs/edge-functions
2. Filter by function: `submit-vendor-application`
3. Look for recent logs
4. Verify you see: `"submit_vendor_application_secure: Called by service_role for user <uuid>"`
5. Verify NO errors like "Unauthorized: You must be logged in"

**Check for Real User Submissions:**

If you had users waiting to submit applications, they should now be able to submit successfully. Monitor for:

- Increase in successful submissions (status 200)
- Decrease in 400/401 errors
- Applications appearing in admin dashboard

**Set up Alerts (Optional):**

Create alerts for:
- Edge Function error rate > 5%
- RPC function errors containing "AUTH_REQUIRED"
- Vendor application submissions (for visibility)

---

## ✅ POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Database migration applied successfully
- [ ] Edge Function deployed (version 8+)
- [ ] Test script passed
- [ ] Test application visible in admin dashboard
- [ ] Edge Function logs show successful calls
- [ ] No 400/401 errors in production logs
- [ ] Real users can submit applications (if applicable)
- [ ] Team notified of successful deployment

---

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PLAN (If Something Goes Wrong)

### Rollback Step 1: Revert Edge Function

```powershell
# Redeploy previous version from git
git checkout HEAD~1 supabase/functions/submit-vendor-application/index.ts
supabase functions deploy submit-vendor-application --project-ref poxjcaogjupsplrcliau
```

### Rollback Step 2: Revert Database Migration

```sql
-- Drop the new function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.submit_vendor_application_secure(UUID, jsonb);

-- Restore old function (from backup or git history)
-- You'll need to find and run the previous migration that created this function
-- Or recreate it from the last known good version
```

**Note**: Rollback is LOW RISK because:
- The new migration is backward compatible
- No data is modified, only function signature
- Edge Function can be redeployed instantly

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

After 24 hours, verify:

| Metric | Before Fix | Target After Fix |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Vendor application success rate | ~0% | >95% |
| 400/401 errors | High | Near zero |
| Average response time | N/A | <500ms |
| Applications submitted | 0 (blocked) | Normal flow resumed |

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Migration fails with "function already exists"

**Solution**: The old function might still exist. Drop it first:
```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.submit_vendor_application_secure(jsonb);
-- Then re-run the migration
```

### Issue: Edge Function deployed but test still fails with 400

**Check**: Verify the RPC is actually using the new signature:
```sql
SELECT pg_get_function_arguments(oid) 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'submit_vendor_application_secure';
```

If it shows only `jsonb` (not `uuid, jsonb`), the migration didn't apply. Re-run it.

### Issue: Test passes but real users still get errors

**Check**: Different error than before? The fix solves the auth.uid() issue. If users now get different errors (e.g., validation errors), those are separate issues and should be addressed individually.

### Issue: Edge Function logs show "Invalid user ID provided"

**Check**: The Edge Function might not be passing `user.id` correctly. Verify:
1. Edge Function code has `p_user_id: user.id` in the RPC call
2. The `user` object exists (auth didn't fail)
3. Redeploy Edge Function if needed
